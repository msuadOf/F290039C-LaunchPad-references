# Enhanced Capture Module (eCAP)

The C2000 enhanced capture module allows time-based logging of external signal 
transitions. It is used to accurately time external events by time stamping 
transitions on the capture input pin. 

```{admonition} Note: 
For dual-core devices, control peripherals are common
between the two CPU subsystems. After reset they are connected to the CPU1
subsystem, and a series of CPU Select registers are used to configure each
peripheral individually to be either controlled by the CPU1 or CPU2 subsystem.
``` 
eCAP can be used to measure the speed of a rotating machine, determine the
elapsed time between pulses, calculate the period and duty cycle of a pulse
train signal, and decode current/voltage measurements derived from duty cycle
encoded current/voltage sensors.

Capture units can be configured to trigger an A/D conversion that is
synchronized with an external event. There are several potential advantages to
using the capture for this function over the ADCEXTSOC pin associated with the
ADC module. 

   * The ADCEXTSOC pin is level triggered, and therefore only low to high
     external signal transitions can start a conversion. The capture unit does
     not suffer from this limitation since it is edge triggered and can be
     configured to start a conversion on either rising edges or falling
     edges. 

   * If the ADCEXTSOC pin is held high longer than one conversion period, a
     second conversion will be immediately initiated upon completion of the
     first. This unwanted second conversion could still be in progress when a
     desired conversion is needed. In addition, if the end-of-conversion ADC
     interrupt is enabled, this second conversion will trigger an unwanted
     interrupt upon its completion. 

<u>The two problems mentioned above are not a concern with the capture unit.</u> 

The capture unit can send an interrupt request to the CPU while it
simultaneously initiates the A/D conversion. This can save time when
computations are driven by an external event since the interrupt allows
preliminary calculations to begin at the start-of-conversion, rather than at
the end-of-conversion using the ADC end-of conversion interrupt. The ADCEXTSOC
pin does not offer a start-of-conversion interrupt. Rather, polling of the
ADCSOC bit in the control register would need to be performed to trap the
externally initiated start of conversion.

## eCAP Module - Capture Mode

The eCAP module captures signal transitions on a dedicated input pin and
sequentially loads a 32-bit time-base counter value in up to four 32-bit
time-stamp capture registers (CAP1 â€“ CAP4).

By using a 32-bit counter, rollover is minimized. Independent edge polarity can
be configured as rising or falling edge, and the module can be run in either
one-shot mode for up to four timestamp events or continuous mode to capture up
to four time-stamp events operating as a circular buffer. 

The capture input pin is routed through the Input X-Bar, allowing any GPIO pin
on the device to be used as the input. Also, the input capture signal can be
pre-scaled and interrupts can be generated on any of the four capture events.
The time-base counter can be run in either absolute or difference
(delta) time-stamp mode. In absolute mode the counter runs continuously,
whereas in difference mode the counter resets on each capture.

## eCAP Module - APWM Mode

![ECAP Block Diagram APWM Mode](images/ecap/ecap_block_diagram_apwm.png)

If the module is not used in capture mode, the eCAP module can be configured to
operate as a single channel asymmetrical PWM module (i.e. time-base counter
operates in count-up mode).

The capture unit interrupts offer immediate CPU notification of externally
captured events. In situations where this is not required, the interrupts can
be masked and flag testing/polling can be used instead. This offers increased
flexibility for resource management. 

**Example: Consider a servo application where a capture unit is being used for
  low-speed velocity estimation via a pulsing sensor.**

The velocity estimate is not used until the next control law calculation is
made, which is driven in real-time using a timer interrupt. Upon entering the
timer interrupt service routine, software can test the capture interrupt flag
bit. If sufficient servo motion has occurred since the last control law
calculation, the capture interrupt flag will be set and software can proceed to
compute a new velocity estimate. If the flag is not set, then sufficient motion
has not occurred and some alternate action would be taken for updating the
velocity estimate. As a second example, consider the case where two successive
captures are needed before a computation proceeds. If the width of the pulse is
needed as soon as the pulse ends, then the capture interrupt is the best
option. However, the capture interrupt will occur after each of the two
captures, the first of which will waste a small number of cycles while the CPU
is interrupted and then determines that it is indeed only the first capture. If
the width of the pulse is not needed as soon as the pulse ends, the CPU can
check, as needed, the capture registers to see if two captures have occurred,
and proceed from there.

# High Resolution Capture (HRCAP)

## HRCAP Overview

The HRCAP module enhances the capture resolution of the eCAP. This is achieved
by using the high-speed asynchronous clock source HRCLK. Some common usage
cases of the HRCAP module include:

* Capacitive touch applications
* High-resolution period and duty cycle measurements of pulse train cycles
* Instantaneous speed measurements
* Instantaneous frequency measurements
* Voltage measurements across an isolation boundary
* Distance/sonar measurement and scanning
* Measuring flow

The features of the HRCAP module include:

* Pulse-width capture in either non-high-resolution or high-resolution modes
* Absolute mode pulse-width capture
* Continuous or one-shot capture
* Interrupt on either falling or rising edge
* Continuous mode capture of pulse widths in 4-deep buffer
* Hardware calibration logic for precision high-resolution capture

Additionally, each HRCAP-capable channel has the following independent key resources:

* All hardware of the respective eCAP
* High-resolution calibration logic
* Dedicated calibration interrupt

## HRCAP Initialization Sequence

To set up the HRCAP to make time-converted measurements:
1. Configure the eCAP module as desired, including interrupts
2. Enable interrupts using `HRCAP_enableCalibrationInterrupt()`
3. Enable continuous calibration using `HRCAP_setCalibrationMode()`
4. Set calibration period using `HRCAP_setCalibrationPeriod()`
5. Enable HR mode using `HRCAP_enableHighResolution()`
6. Enable HRCLK using `HRCAP_enableHighResolutionCLock()`
7. Delay 1 microsecond
8. Start calibration using `HRCAP_startCalibration()`

Steps 2, 3, 4, and 8 only apply for time-converted measurements. When using the
HRCAP to take relative-time measurements, only steps 1, 5, 6, and 7 are
required. Note that not all eCAP modules have the HRCAP capability, see your
device data sheet for more details.

## HRCAP Calibration

It has been observed that high-speed clocks such as HRCLK are highly sensitive
to temperature and voltage fluctuations. This can cause error in the HRCAP
measurements. To further mitigate the effects of error due to temperature and
voltage changes, the HRCAP has a built-in calibration unit for time-converted
measurements. The calibration unit can be used to determine a scaling factor
ratio between the system clock (SYSCLK) and HRCLK, which allows for the
estimated period of HRCLK to be expressed in terms of the SYSCLK period.

The scaling factor is calculated using two free-running 32 bit counters
HRSYSCLKCNT and HRCLKCNT, which are fed by SYSCLK and HRCLK, respectively. When
HRSYSCLKCNT equals the programmable value of HRCALIBPERIOD, the values in
HRSYSCLKCNT and HRCLKCNT are stored in HRSYSCLKCAP and HRCLKCAP, respectively.
An interrupt is then triggered, which allows a new scaling factor to be
calculated via the equation: ScaleFactor=HRSYSCLKCAP/HRCLKCAP. Therefore, a
time-converted measurement from the HRCAP can be converted to nano-seconds
using

(ECAP_REGS_CAPx\*ScaleFactor\*SYSCLKPRD)/128,

where 128 is a constant determined by the hardware of the HRCAP module. It is
important to note that in most cases, HRCALIBPERIOD is selected in such a way
that the value of HRCLKCAP will be much larger than HRSYSCLKCAP, which
effectively averages the period of HRCLK and thus yields more accurate
readings.

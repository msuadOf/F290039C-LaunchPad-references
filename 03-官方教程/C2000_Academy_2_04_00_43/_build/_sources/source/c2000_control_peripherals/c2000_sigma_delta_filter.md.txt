# Sigma Delta Filter Module (SDFM)

The C2000 Sigma Delta Filter Module (SDFM) is a four-channel digital filter
designed specifically for **current measurement** in motor control
applications.

## What is Delta-Sigma Modulation?

Delta-Sigma Modulation is a type of modulation used to encode an analog signal
into a digital bit stream. Intuitively speaking, since the delta-sigma
modulated bit stream must encode enough information to reasonably reconstruct
the original signal, a clock speed much higher than the Nyquist rate is used in
delta-sigma modulation devices. Decoding a delta-sigma modulated bit stream
involves passing the signal through a digital low pass filter, followed by a
decimation stage, which is also known as down sampling. The resulting signal is
a sampled version of the original analog signal which can be processed
digitally for a wide range of applications.

## SDFM Module Overview

Each channel can receive an independent delta-sigma modulator bit stream

* Bit streams are processed by four individually programmable digital decimation filters

   * Filters include a fast comparator for immediate digital threshold
        comparisons for over-current and under-current monitoring

   * A filter-bypass mode is available to enable data logging, analysis, and
        customized filtering

The SDFM pins are configured using the GPIO multiplexer. A key benefit of the
SDFM is it enables a simple, cost effective, and safe high-voltage isolation
boundary.

## Isolated Phase Current-Sense Example

SDFM enables galvanic isolation when utilized in conjunction with isolated
sigma delta modulators.

## How to improve SDFM Noise Immunity:

Special precautions should be taken on both SD-Cx and SD-Dx signals to ensure a
clean and noise free signal that meets SDFM timing requirements. Precautions
such as series termination resistors for ringing noise due to any impedance
mismatch of clock driver and spacing of traces from other noisy signals are
recommended.

Improper routing and layout of SDFM Clock and data traces on PCB can create 
signal integrity issues and sample and hold violations.

TI provides an application report which discusses the best practices for 
clock and data line routing and termination when using isolated sigma delta modulators.

TI highly recommends using `mode 0` as it provides best filter performance in noisy conditions

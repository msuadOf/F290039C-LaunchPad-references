# Communications Overview

C2000 devices contain features that allow several methods of communication and data
exchange between the MCU and other devices. Many of the most commonly used
communication techniques are presented in this module.

The intent of this module is not to give exhaustive design details of the
communication peripherals, but rather to provide an overview of the features
and capabilities. Once these features and capabilities are understood,
additional information can be obtained from various resources such as
documentation, as needed. 

# Communications Techniques 

Several methods of
implementing a communications system are possible. The method selected for a
particular design should be one that meets the required data rate
at the lowest cost. Various categories of interface are available. Each of the
categories will be described in this module.

Serial ports provide a simple, hardware-efficient means of high-level
communication between devices. Like the GPIO pins, they may be used in
stand-alone or multiprocessing systems.

In a multiprocessing system, they are an excellent choice when both devices have
an identical serial port and the data rate requirement is relatively low.
Serial interface is even more desirable when the devices are physically distant
from each other because the inherently low number of wires provides a simpler
interconnection.

Serial ports require separate lines to implement, and they do not interfere in
any way with the data and address lines of the processor. The only overhead
they require is to read/write new words from/to the ports as each word is
received/transmitted. This process can be performed as a short interrupt
service routine under hardware control, requiring only a few cycles to
maintain.

The C28x family of devices have both synchronous and asynchronous serial
ports. 

## Synchronous

* Short Distance (on-board)
* High data rate
* Explicit clock

## Asynchronous

* Longer distances
* Lower data rate (~1/8 of SPI)
* Implied clock (clk/data mixed)
* Economical with reasonable performance

# Power Management Bus (PMBus)

PMBus is an open standard for digital communication between 
power converters and other components in power systems. The PMBus protocol
is based on the I2C protocol and has several extensions that make it
suitable for power management applications.

```{admonition} PMBus Module
Not all C2000 devices have a PMBus module. Refer to the 
<i>[Peripheral Reference Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/spru566)</i>
for a list of supported modules on your device.
```

## Key Features

* Provides an interface between the MCU and devices compliant with the SMI Forum PMBus Specification:

  * Part I version 1.0 and Part II version 1.1

  * Enables a standard 2-wire communications protocol between power supply components

* Based on SMBus and supports I2C mode

  * Uses a similar physical layer to I2C

* Support for controller and target modes

* Support for two speeds:

  * Standard Mode: Up to 100 kHz

  * Fast Mode: 400 kHz

* Four-byte transmit and receive buffers

* Packet error checking (PEC) 

## Conceptual Block Diagram

* SCL is the bus clock

  * Normally controlled by the controller; can be held low by a target to delay a
    transaction (to allow more time for processing)

* SDA is the bidirectional data line

* CONTROL is a target input that can trigger an interrupt

  * Can be used to tell a target device to shut down

* ALERT is a target output/controller input

  * Allows a target to request attention from the controller

## PMBus Summary

   * Provides a standard and flexible means for digital power management

   * SDA and SCL timings derived from SYSCLK (to comply with the PMBus timing
     specifications the bit clock must be set to 10 MHz or less)

   * Four-byte Transmit Data Buffer

   * Four-byte Receive Data Buffer

   * Clock high and low time-outs

   * CONTROL and ALERT signals

# Serial Communication Interface (SCI)

The SCI is a two-wire
asynchronous serial port (also known as a UART) that supports communications
between the processor and other asynchronous peripherals that use the standard
non-return-to-zero (NRZ) format. 

In addition, the C28x SCI is a full duplex interface which provides for
simultaneous data transmit and receive. Parity checking and data formatting is
also designed to be done by the port hardware, further reducing software
overhead.

## SCI Pin Connections

A receiver and transmitter FIFO is used to
reduce servicing overhead. The SCI transmit and receive registers are both
double-buffered to prevent data collisions and allow for efficient CPU usage.

## SCI Data Format

![SCI Data Format](images/sci_data_format.png)

The basic unit of data is called a **character** and is 1 to 8 bits in length.
Each character of data is formatted with a start bit, 1 or 2 stop bits, an
optional parity bit, and an optional address/data bit. 

A character of data along with its formatting bits is called a **frame**. Frames
are organized into groups called blocks. If more than two serial ports exist on
the SCI bus, a block of data will usually begin with an address frame which
specifies the destination port of the data as determined by the userâ€™s
protocol.

The beginning of a frame is marked by the start bit going low. 

The SCI uses a **NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero)** format which
means that in an inactive state the SCIRX and SCITX lines will be held high.

Peripherals are expected to pull the SCIRX and SCITX lines to a high level when
they are not receiving or transmitting on their respective lines.


## SCI Data Timing

* 8 SCICLK periods per data bit

* Start bit valid if 4 consecutive SCICLK periods of zero bits after falling edge

* Majority vote taken on 4th, 5th, and 6th SCICLK cycles

## Multiprocessor Wake-Up Modes

* Allows numerous processors to be hooked up to the bus, but transmission occurs
  between only two of them

* Idle-line or Address-bit modes

* Sequence of Operation

  * Potential receivers set SLEEP=1, which disables RXINT except when an address
    frame is received

  * All transmissions begin with an address frame

  * Incoming address frame temporarily wakes up all SCIs on bus

  * CPUs compare incoming SCI address to their SCI address

  * Process following data frames only if address matches

## Idle-Line Wake-Up Mode

* Idle time separates blocks of frames

* Receiver wakes up when SCIRXD high for 10 or more bit periods

* Two transmit address methods

  * Deliberate software delay of 10 or more bits

  * Set TXWAKE bit to automatically leave exactly 11 idle bits

## Address-Bit Wake-Up Mode

* All frames contain an extra address bit

* Receiver wakes up when address bit detected

* Automatic setting of Addr/Data bit in frame by setting TXWAKE=1 prior to
  writing address to SCITXBUF

## SCI Interrupts

The SCI interrupt logic generates interrupt flags when it receives or transmits
a complete character as determined by the SCI character length. This provides a
convenient and efficient way of timing and controlling the operation of the SCI
transmitter and receiver. 

**Interrupt Flags**

The interrupt flag for the transmitter is TXRDY, and for the
receiver RXRDY. 

**How is the TX Interrupt Flag set?**

TXRDY is set when a character is transferred to
TXSHF and SCITXBUF is ready to receive the next character. In addition, when
both the SCIBUF and TXSHF registers are empty, the TX EMPTY flag is
set. 

**How is the RX Interrupt Flag set?**

When a new character has been received and shifted into SCIRXBUF, the
RXRDY flag is set. In addition, the BRKDT flag is set if a break condition
occurs. 

**What is a break detect?**

A break condition is where the SCIRXD line remains continuously low for at least
ten bits, beginning after a missing stop bit. This error flag is cleared
through a software reset of the SCI through "SWRESET".

**SCI Error Flags**

Additional flag and interrupt capability exists for other receiver errors. The
RX ERROR flag is the logical OR of the break detect (BRKDT), framing error
(FE), receiver overrun (OE), and parity error (PE) bits. RX ERROR high
indicates that at least one of these four errors has occurred during
transmission. This will also send an interrupt request to the CPU if the RX ERR
INT ENA bit is set.

# Multichannel Buffered Serial Port (McBSP)

The McBSP provides a high-speed direct interface to CODECs, analog interface
chips (AICs), and other serially connected A/D and D/A devices. It has
double-buffered transmission and triple buffered reception for supporting
continuous data streams. There are 128 channels for transmission and reception,
data size selections of 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 bits.

The McBSP module can also be operated in SPI mode and used as another
SPI interface.

```{admonition} McBSP Module
Not all C2000 devices have a McBSP module. Refer to the 
<i>[Peripheral Reference Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/spru566)</i>
for a list of supported modules on your device.
```

## McBSP Block Diagram

The McBSP module consists of several signal lines that are used to
control the data transfer between the C2000 device and the external
device. 

1. **MCLKX (Transmit Clock)-** The clock signal generated
by the C2000 device that is used to synchronize the data
transmission from the C2000 device to the external device

2. **MSFX (Transmit Frame Sync)-** Indicates the start
and the end of a data frame during transmission from the C2000
device to the external device.

3. **MDX (Transmit Data)-** Data signal tranmitted from 
the C2000 device to the external device.

4. **MCKR (Receive Clock)-** Clock signal geneated by the
external device that is used to synchronize the data transmission
from the external device to the C2000 device.

5. **MFSR (Receive Frame Sync)-** Indicates the start and end of a 
data fram during tranmission from the extneral device to the 
C2000 device.

6. **MDR (Receive Data)-** Data signal received from the external
device by the C2000 device.

## Definition: Bit, Word, and Frame

Phrase        | Description   
--------------|----------------------------
Bit           | One data bit per serial clock period
Word/channel  | Contains number of bits (8,12,16,20,24,32)
Frame         | Contains one or multiple words (1-128 words per frame)

## Multi-Channel Selection

![McBSP Multi-Channel](images/mcbsp_multi_channel.png)


* Allows multiple channels (words) to be **independently** selected for
   transmit and receive (e.g. only enable Ch0, 5, 27 for receive, then process
   via CPU)

* The McBSP keeps time sync with all channels, but only "listens" or "talks" if
  the specific channel is enabled (reduces processing/bus overhead)

* Multi-channel mode controlled primarily via two registers: Multi-channel Control Reg and Rec/Xmt Channel Enable Regs

* Up to 128 channels can be enabled/disabled


## McBSP Summary

   * Independent clocking and framing for transmit and receive

   * Internal or external clock and frame sync

   * Data size of 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, or 32 bits

   * TDM mode - up to 128 channels (used for T1/E1 interfacing)

   * SPI mode

   * Direct interface to many codecs

   * Can be serviced by the DMA

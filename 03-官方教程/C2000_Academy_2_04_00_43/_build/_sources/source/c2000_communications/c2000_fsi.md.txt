# Fast Serial Interface (FSI)

The FSI module is a highly reliable high-speed serial communication peripheral
capable of operating at dual data rate, providing 100 Mbps transfer using a 50
MHz clock. 

The FSI consists of independent transmitter and receiver cores that are
configured and operated independently.

FSI is a point-to-point communication protocol operating in a single main
node/single remote node configuration. With this high-speed data rate and low
channel count, the FSI can be used to increase the amount of information
transmitted and reduce the costs to communicate over an isolation barrier.

```{admonition} FSI Module
Not all C2000 devices have an FSI module. Refer to the 
[Peripheral Reference Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/spru566)
for a list of supported modules on your device.

## FSI Features

* Ensure reliable high-speed serial communication across an isolation barrier
  (provides galvanic isolation where different circuits do not have common
  power and ground connections)

* Consists of independent transmitter (FSITX) and receiver (FSIRX) cores

* Each core is configured and operated independently

* Point-to-point (single main node/single remote node)

* Fast transfer: 50 MHz

* Dual data rate (100 Mbps @ 50 MHz clock)

* Single or dual data lines

* Programmable data length

* Hardware- or software-calculated CRC

* Frame error detection

* Two interrupts per FSI core

## Transmitter/ Receiver Core Signals

### Transmitter Core Signals

Signal     | Description                                 | Multi-lane transmission
-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
TXCLK      | Transmit clock                              | 
TXD0       | Primary data output line for transmission   | Contains all the even numbered bits of the data and CRC bytes/ Other frame fields will be transmitted in full
TXD1       | Additional data output line for transmission| Contains all the odd numbered bits of the data and CRC bytes/ Applies only to the data words and the CRC bytes

### Receiver Core Signals

Signal     | Description                              | Connection
-----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
RXCLK      | Receive clock                            | Connected to the TXCLK of the transmitting FSI module
RXD0       | Primary data input line for reception    | Connected to the TXD0 of the transmitting FSI module
RXD1       | Additional data input line for reception | Connected to the TXD1 of the transmitting FSI module if multilane transmission is used

```{admonition} Note:
While there is no true concept of a main node or a remote node in the FSI protocol,
this example uses this nomenclature as a simple way to describe the data flow

```

## FSI Summary

* Highly reliable high-speed serial peripheral for communicating over an
 isolation barrier

* High-speed data rate and low channel count (increases the amount of
 information transmitted and reduce the costs)

* Separate transmit and receive modules

* Point-to-point communication protocol (FSI transmitter core communicates
 directly to a single FSI receiver core)

* Skew compensation for signal delay due to isolation

* Line break detection

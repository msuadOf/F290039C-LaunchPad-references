# Functional Safety (FuSa) 

The C2000 family has many devices which are safety compliant for industrial 
and automotive use-cases. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
defines functional safety as the part of overall safety that depends on a 
system or equipment operating correctly in response to its inputs. Development 
of functional safety-compliant systems capable of ensuring safe operation in 
the event of dangerous failures has become a priority for companies and 
engineers alike. These functional safety-compliant systems can detect 
potentially dangerous conditions and deploy appropriate measures to take 
a system to a safe state.

Functional Safety-Compliant C2000 products can help streamline and speed up 
the ISO 26262, IEC 61508, and IEC 60730 certification processes with their 
built-in diagnostics, documentation, software, and support. Functional 
Safety-Compliant products are developed using an ISO 26262/IEC 61508-compliant 
hardware development process that is independently assessed and certified to 
meet ASIL D/SIL 3 systematic capability.

## Hardware

With over 300 safety mechanisms defined and independently assessed by TÜV SÜD
for its effectiveness, Functional Safety-Compliant C2000 MCUs provide the
required diagnostic coverage to meet a random hardware capability of up to ASIL
B or SIL 2 at a component level. Device-specific functional safety manuals
provide detailed information on the safety mechanisms, techniques for achieving
non-interference between elements and avoiding dependent failures, to aid
customers in the development of compliant systems.

## Software

Three software diagnostic libraries are available for C2000 devices to help 
provide implementations and demonstrations of several key safety mechanisms 
described in the device safety manuals. They are the C2000 Software Diagnostic 
Library (SDL), the CLA Self-Test Library (CLA_STL), and the C28x Self-Test 
Library (C28x_STL).

The C2000 SDL is a collection of reference implementations of several safety 
mechanisms. These include software-based diagnostics, software tests of 
hardware diagnostics, and demonstrations of how to use hardware diagnostics. 
Examples include clock integrity checks using a CPU Timer, software tests of 
SRAMs, software tests of SRAM parity/ECC logic, software tests of the watchdog, 
and drivers for the Hardware Built-In Self-Test (HWBIST) module. The SDL is 
provided as part of C2000Ware.

The CLA_STL and C28x_STL implement specific safety mechanisms “CLA2 – Software 
Test of CLA” and “CPU3 – Software Test of CPU” respectively (see your device 
safety manual for more about these mechanisms). The STLs were developed using 
the TÜV SÜD certified TI internal software development process and have been 
independently assessed and certified. They are available upon request.

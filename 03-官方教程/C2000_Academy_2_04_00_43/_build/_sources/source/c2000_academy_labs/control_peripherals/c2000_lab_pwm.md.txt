# Enhanced Pulse Width Modulation (ePWM) Lab

The objective of this lab is to gain familiarity with the Enhanced Pulse Width
Modulation (ePWM) module through a guided lab example. This lab will walk
through generating a PWM signal of a specified frequency and duty cycle. It
will then walk through the steps of sampling that PWM signal with the ADC,
which requires using a second PWM signal to trigger the ADC. We will also
measure the duty cycle and period of our first PWM signal with the eCAP module.
This lab should leave readers more knowledgeable about the capabilities of
C2000's ePWM, eCAP, and ADC modules.

## Solution

All solutions are located in the directory: `[C2000Ware_Install_Path]/training/device/[device_name]`.

## Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Sysconfig GUI to generate a waveform with one of
the ePWM modules. The period and duty cycle of the PWM waveform will be
measured by one of the eCAP modules. In addition, we will sample the PWM
waveform using the ADC. We will store the corresponding samples in a circular
buffer, which will allow us to view the PWM waveform inside of a Code Composer
Studio debug session. The SysConfig GUI tool will also be used to configure the
eCAP and ADC modules.

## Lab Setup

### Hardware Setup

You will need the following hardware for this lab:

* A C2000 controlCARD or LaunchPad with the supplied USB cable.
* Jumper cables.
* Oscilloscope (optional).

Use the supplied USB cable to connect your C2000 board's USB port to the
standard USB Type-A connector in your computer. You should see some LEDs light
up on your board. In addition to powering the board, a JTAG communication link
is also established between the device and Code Composer Studio. 

Later in the lab we will be routing the output pin of the PWM waveform to the
input pin of the ADC, so make sure that you have enough jumper cables to
facilitate this.

### Software Setup

The following software will need to be installed on your computer:

* [Code Composer Studio](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO-C2000)
* [C2000Ware](https://www.ti.com/tool/C2000WARE)

## Import Empty Project

Our first task is to import an empty project to our Code Composer
Studio (CCS) workspace. 
The basic instructions are as follows:

1. Open CCS and go to **Project→Import CCS Projects**. A new window should
   appear. Ensure that the **Select search-directory** option is activated.
2. Click the **Browse** button and select the
   `[C20000ware_Install_dir]/training/device/[device]/empty_lab`
   directory. 
   Note that the default Windows [C20000ware_Install_dir] is `C:/ti/c2000/C2000Ware_4_xx_xx_xx`.
3. Under **Discovered Projects**, you should now see the
   `lab_[board]_[device]` project. Select the appropriate project for either the control card or the launchpad. 
   
![Discovered_Projects](images/pwm_lab/c2000_lab_epwm_ecap_start_small.png)
      
4. Click **Finish** to import and copy the `lab_[board]_[device]` project
   into your workspace.
5. Rename the project to your liking
   - "Right-click on the project in Project Explorer pane". Select 'Rename' from
      the drop down menu and rename the project to 'c2000_epwm_lab' or a name
      of your choosing.
   - Now click the 'Down Arrow' located to the left of the imported project to
     expand it and select lab_main.c. Right-click on the file, and
     select 'Rename' to rename the file to c2000_epwm_lab_main.c or a name of
     your choosing.

## Configure the GPIO

We will configure the necessary GPIO pins as shown below. Our PWM
waveform will be output from ePWM1A. We will also
configure one of the board LEDs as an indicator. 

## Steps to add GPIO configuration:

* In the project, open the `.syscfg` file by double-clicking it.
* In the SysConfig GUI, select the "Hardware" tab, as shown below.

## Configure ePWM1 and ePWM2

```{admonition} For Devices F2837xD, F2837xS, F2838x, and F28003x:

The SYSCLK generated from the internal oscillator is higher than 100MHz on these
devices. This means that the EPWM clock for F28003x is 120MHz. The maximum EPWM
clock is still 100MHz on  F2837xD, F2837xS, and F2838x, but the ADC clock is
equal to the device SYSCLK. When clock dividers are selected in the following
modules, you may need to modify your dividers to achieve exactly the same
results.

You may also notice that your device has different parameters than the ones seen
in the images below. Do not worry, as all of the essential parameters for this
lab are available on all devices.

```

In this section, we will first configure ePWM1A to output a 2kHz PWM waveform
with a 25% duty cycle. We begin by setting the ePWM clock prescalars. The
ePWM clock frequency has been set to be 100MHz. If you have a F2837xD or F2838x
based device, the ePWM clock frequency is half of `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ` by
default, otherwise `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ` and the ePWM clock frequency are
equal. Since the time base counter is 16 bits wide and (10^8/2000 < 2^16), 
there is no need to divide the ePWM clock. Hence, we set the clock
division to 1.

Next, we set the time base period. In this lab, we will use the up/down
counting mode for a symmetric PWM waveform, which leads to

$\text{Time Base Period}=\frac{f_{tbclk}}{2f_{pwm}}=\frac{100* 10^6}{2* 2000}=25000.$

Note that for the strict up or down counting mode,

$\text{Time Base Period}=\frac{f_{tbclk}}{f_{pwm}}-1.$

Additionally, we have set the period load mode to shadow and set the phase
shift to be 0 since we will not be performing any synchronization.

Now we will configure the parameters of the counter compare module for ePWM1A
to achieve a 25% duty cycle. Since we are in up/down counting mode, a counter
compare event will happen twice: once during the up count, and once during the
down count. This suggests that

$\text{Counter Compare Value}=(1-\frac{duty}{100})* tbprd=(1-\frac{25}{100})25000=18750$

for a 25% duty cycle. Notice that the global variable `PwmDuty` has been
initialized accordingly. For the strict up or down count modes,

$\text{Counter Compare Value}=(1-\frac{duty}{100})*(tbprd+1)-1.$

Next, we set the counter compare load mode to load a new counter compare value
on zero or at the period count. This will allow us to change the value of
`PwmDuty` in a real-time CCS debug session. Shadow load mode is also enabled to
avoid output glitches when we change the counter compare value.

Finally, we set the counter mode to up/down mode. Note that we still have not
enabled the clock to the ePWM modules. This completes the configuration of
ePWM1A.

In order to view the PWM waveform in CCS, we must sample the PWM waveform using
the ADC. The ePWM modules can be used to trigger a SOC event on the ADC. We
will use this technique to sample our PWM waveform with a sampling rate of
50kHz using ePWM2. The first steps in the configuration of ePWM2 are identical
to ePWM1. However, we will use the up count mode rather than the up/down
counting mode, thus, to achieve a sampling rate of 50kHz, we need

$\text{Time Base Period}=\frac{100* 10^6}{50000}-1=1999.$

Next, we configure ePWM2 to trigger SOCA on the ADC. Notice that the trigger
source is set to be the time base period event, hence, a SOC event will happen
at a rate of 50kHz. The event prescale setting is set to 1 since we would like
the SOC to happen at each time base period event.

![EPWM2_3](images/pwm_lab/lab_epwm2_3.png)
 

This concludes the configuration of the ePWM modules.

## Configure the ADC

In the previous section, we explained that ePWM2 would be triggering a SOC
event on the ADC. In this section, we will provide the code to configure the
ADC. More details about the configuration of the ADC can be found in 
[Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)](../../c2000_analog_subsystem/c2000_analog_to_digital_converter.md).
However, notice that we have setup a SOC to be triggered by ePWM2 and that we
have setup the ADC to interrupt at the end of a conversion. Hence, the
interrupt service routine will be triggered at a rate of 50kHz. The ADC is also
setup in continuous mode so that the ADC register always contains the most
recent sample.
* Add ADC by clicking the '+' by ADC in the SysConfig screen. Make sure to make
  the changes circled below. If your device SYSCLK is not 100MHz, you will need
  to change the ADC Clock Prescaler to acheive the same results. 
* For the 'SOC0 Sample Window[SYSCLK counts]' parameter, the same value may
  result in a different 'SOC0 Sample Time[ns]' on different devices, due to
  varying SYSCLK frequencies across devices. Make sure that the generated 'SOC0
  Sample Time[ns]' is about 80ns.

![ADC1](images/pwm_lab/epwm_adc_1.png)
  
* Expand the 'Register PIE Interrupt Handlers' dropdown menu, and register
  Interrupt 1, as shown below. This should trigger the 'ADCA Interrupt 1'
  dropdown menu to appear.
* Expand the 'ADCA Interrupt 1' dropdown menu, and change the interrupt handler
  to 'adcA1ISR'. Make sure this interrupt handler matches the name of the
  interrupt in the ISR code snippet below. Also click the checkbox to enable
  the interrupt in PIE, as shown below.

reference of 2.5V.

![ASYSCTL](images/pwm_lab/lab_adc_internal_ref.png)
 

```

## Define the ADC interrupt service routine

In this section, we will define the ADC interrupt service routine. This
interrupt service routine will store samples from the ADC in a circular buffer
so we can view the PWM waveform using the real-time debug features in CCS. The
necessary code is shown below. In addition to storing the ADC samples in a
circular buffer, this interrupt service routine also toggles one of the board
LEDs at a rate of 1Hz and allows for the duty cycle of ePWM1A to be changed on
the fly or modulated during a CCS debug session. The global flag variable
`DutyModOn` controls whether or not the duty cycle is modulated. When
`DutyModOn` is set, the PWM waveform duty cycle will change slowly from 5% to
95% and alternate between increasing and decreasing.

```
__interrupt void adcA1ISR(void)
{
    // Clear interrupt flags.
    Interrupt_clearACKGroup(INT_myADC0_1_INTERRUPT_ACK_GROUP);
    ADC_clearInterruptStatus(myADC0_BASE, ADC_INT_NUMBER1);
    // Write contents of the ADC register to a circular buffer.
    *AdcBufPtr = ADC_readResult(myADC0_RESULT_BASE, myADC0_SOC0);
    if (AdcBufPtr == (AdcBuf + 49))
    {
        // Force buffer to wrap around.
        AdcBufPtr = AdcBuf;
    } else {
        AdcBufPtr += 1;
    }
    if (LedCtr &gt;= 49999) {
        // Divide 50kHz sample rate by 50e3 to toggle LED at a rate of 1Hz.
        GPIO_togglePin(myBoardLED0_GPIO);
        LedCtr = 0;
    } else {
        LedCtr += 1;
    }
    if (DutyModOn) {
        // Divide 50kHz sample rate by 16 to slow down duty modulation.
        if (DutyModCtr &gt;= 15) {
            if (DutyModDir == 0) {
                // Increment State =&gt; Decrease Duty Cycle.
                if (ePwm_curDuty &gt;= ePwm_MinDuty) {
                    DutyModDir = 1;
                } else {
                    ePwm_curDuty += 1;
                }
            } else {
                // Decrement State =&gt; Increase Duty Cycle.
                if (ePwm_curDuty &lt;= ePwm_MaxDuty) {
                    DutyModDir = 0;
                } else {
                    ePwm_curDuty -= 1;
                }
            }
            DutyModCtr = 0;
        } else {
            DutyModCtr += 1;
        }
    }
    // Set the counter compare value.
    EPWM_setCounterCompareValue(myEPWM0_BASE, EPWM_COUNTER_COMPARE_A, ePwm_curDuty);
}
```

## Configure eCAP1

We can use the eCAP peripheral to measure the duty cycle and period of our PWM
waveform. We start by resetting the eCAP1 peripheral, disabling time stamp
capture, and stopping the internal counter. This will put the eCAP1 registers
in a known state, and it will freeze the internal eCAP counter. This way, when
we start the eCAP, it will initially behave in a predictable manner which can
be important for many practical usage scenarios. Notice that `XBAR_INPUT7` has
been mapped to GPIO0 which contains our PWM waveform. Accordingly, the input of
eCAP1 is set to be `ECAP_INPUT_INPUTXBAR7`.
 

The following code enables continuous capture mode with 4 sequential
timestamped events. Notice the configuration of the 4 different event
polarities. This configuration allows us to measure the duty cycle from events
1 and 2, and measure the period from events 1 and 3. Since we need the internal
counter to hold its count from event 1 to event 4, we have disabled the counter 
reset on these events.

Next, we enable an interrupt after event 3 is captured. This allows us to
calculate the period and duty cycle in the interrupt service routine.

* Add ECAP by clicking '+' in SysConfig screen, and apply the changes circled below.

![ECAP1](images/pwm_lab/ecap_1.png)

* Expand the 'eCAP Interrupt' dropdown menu, and change the interrupt handler
  to 'ecap1ISR'. Make sure this interrupt handler matches the name of the
  interrupt in the ISR code snippet below. Also click the checkbox to enable
  the interrupt in PIE, as shown below.

![ECAP2](images/pwm_lab/ecap_2.png)
 
* Add INPUTXBAR by clicking '+' in SysConfig screen, and apply the changes
  circled below. Make sure the interrupt handler matches the name of the
  interrupt in the ISR code snippet below.

![INPUTXBAR](images/pwm_lab/inputxbar.png)

This concludes the configuration of the eCAP and inputXbar.

## Define the eCAP interrupt service routine

In the last section, we enabled an interrupt on the eCAP. The corresponding
interrupt service routine is named `ecap1ISR` and is shown below. The global
variable `eCapPwmPeriod` stores the difference between the eCAP timestamps from
event 3 and 1, which allows us to calculate the period. Since the eCAP units
operate on the system clock, the frequency of the PWM waveform can be
calculated using

$f_{pwm}\approx\frac{\text{DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ}}{\text{eCapPwmPeriod}}.$

The global variable `eCapPwmDuty` stores the difference between the eCAP
timestamps from event 2 and 1, which allows us to calculate the duty cycle. The
duty cycle can be calculated vias

$\text{duty}\approx\frac{\text{eCapPwmDuty}}{\text{eCapPwmPeriod}}100.$

```
__interrupt void ecap1ISR(void)
{
    Interrupt_clearACKGroup(INT_myECAP0_INTERRUPT_ACK_GROUP);
    ECAP_clearGlobalInterrupt(myECAP0_BASE);
    ECAP_clearInterrupt(myECAP0_BASE, ECAP_ISR_SOURCE_CAPTURE_EVENT_3);
    eCapPwmDuty = (int32_t)ECAP_getEventTimeStamp(myECAP0_BASE, ECAP_EVENT_2) -
                  (int32_t)ECAP_getEventTimeStamp(myECAP0_BASE, ECAP_EVENT_1);
    eCapPwmPeriod = (int32_t)ECAP_getEventTimeStamp(myECAP0_BASE, ECAP_EVENT_3) -
                    (int32_t)ECAP_getEventTimeStamp(myECAP0_BASE, ECAP_EVENT_1);
}
```

## Define Global Macros and Variables

First, we will define some necessary macros and global variables. 

```
uint32_t ePwm_TimeBase;
uint32_t ePwm_MinDuty;
uint32_t ePwm_MaxDuty;
uint32_t ePwm_curDuty;
uint16_t AdcBuf[50];            // Buffer to store ADC samples.
uint16_t *AdcBufPtr = AdcBuf;   // Pointer to ADC buffer samples.
uint16_t LedCtr = 0;            // Counter to slow down LED toggle in ADC ISR.
uint16_t DutyModOn = 0;         // Flag to turn on/off duty cycle modulation.
uint16_t DutyModDir = 0;        // Flag to control duty mod direction up/down.
uint16_t DutyModCtr = 0;        // Counter to slow down rate of modulation.
int32_t eCapPwmDuty;            // Percent = (eCapPwmDuty/eCapPwmPeriod)*100.
int32_t eCapPwmPeriod;          // Frequency = DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ/eCapPwmPeriod.
```

## Define main()

Next, we will populate `main()` as shown below. 

That being said, we will still need to know the system clock frequency in order
to configure our PWM waveform frequency. The system clock frequency value is
defined via the macro `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ` in `[projectroot]/device/device.h`. Observe that
the main function only handles initialization routines. Most of the activity in
this lab lies in the peripherals themselves and their interrupt service
routines.

```
void main(void)
{
    Device_init();
    Interrupt_initModule();
    Interrupt_initVectorTable();
    Board_init();
    // Initialize variables for ePWM Duty Cycle
    ePwm_TimeBase = EPWM_getTimeBasePeriod(myEPWM0_BASE);
    ePwm_MinDuty = (uint32_t)(0.95f * (float)ePwm_TimeBase);
    ePwm_MaxDuty = (uint32_t)(0.05f * (float)ePwm_TimeBase);
    ePwm_curDuty = EPWM_getCounterCompareValue(myEPWM0_BASE, EPWM_COUNTER_COMPARE_A);
    EINT;
    ERTM;
    for (;;) {
        NOP;
    }
}
```

This concludes the coding portion of this lab.

## Build and run interactive debug session

1. Ensure that the USB cable from your LaunchPad or controlCARD is connected to
   your computer. 
2. Under the **Build** button, activate the **CPU1_RAM** build configuration.
3. Make sure your project's target configuration file (.ccxml) is active. 
4. Connect the ePWM1A GPIO pin to the ADCINA0 GPIO pin using a jumper cable. If

5. Now we will start the debug session. Under the debug button, start the debug
   session using the new configuration. You should now see the debugging
   session open up and the debugger should have reached `main()`.
6. Click the **Resume** button. You should see the LED on your board toggling
   at about 1Hz which indicates that the sampling rate is 50kHz as desired.
7. Find the `eCapPwmDuty` and `eCapPwmPeriod` global variables in the debug
   source code window, highlight their text, right click, and click **Add Watch
   Expression**. Activate the **Continuous Refresh** option. If all is well,
   the expressions pane should show values of `eCapPwmDuty` and `eCapPwmPeriod`
   such that $\frac{\text{eCapPwmDuty}}{\text{eCapPwmPeriod}}100\approx25$ 
   which indicates the correct duty cycle of 25%. Additionally, 
   $\frac{\text{DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ}}{\text{eCapPwmPeriod}}\approx2000$
   which indicates the correct PWM frequency of 2kHz.

![Watch Expression List](images/pwm_lab/watch_expression.png)

8. Now we will view our waveform from the samples in `AdcBuf`. Click on
  **Tools→Graph→Single Time**, set **Acquisition Buffer Size** to be
  **50**, set **Dsp Data Type** to be **16 bit unsigned integer**, set
  **Sampling Rate Hz** to be **50000**, set **Start Address** to be
  **AdcBuf**, set **Time Display Unit** to be **us**, and leave the other
   settings as their default value. Click **OK** and you should see the plot
   window open up. Activate the **Continuous Refresh** option in the plot
   window. You should now see several periods of the PWM waveform in the plot
   updating in real-time. If desired, you can use the measurement tool to
   verify the duty cycle and period.

9. Next, add `PwmDuty` to the watch expression list. Play with values of
   `PwmDuty` from 1250 to 23750. You should see the duty cycle of the PWM
   waveform change in real-time in the plot window. The readings from the eCAP
   should also update in real-time.
10. Add `DutyModOn` to the watch expression list. Change the value to 1. You
    should now see the duty cycle modulate in real-time from 5% to 95% in the
    plot window.

11. Terminate the debug session and close the project. This concludes the lab
    assignment.

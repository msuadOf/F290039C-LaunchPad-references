# Direct Memory Access (DMA) Lab

In this lab, we will use the Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller to regularly
service the ADC in a real-time data processing application. By using the DMA to
move data, the CPU is saving instruction cycles that could be used on other
critical tasks. Specifically, we will be using the ePWM and ADC modules to
generate and sample a PWM waveform at a chosen sampling rate. The DMA will then
be used to store the ADC samples in a ping pong buffer, so groups of samples
can simultaneously be processed by the CPU in an interrupt service routine
(ISR). In addition to reviewing basics for the ePWM and ADC modules, this lab
should inform readers of how and why the DMA can be used to reduce load on the
CPU. 


```{admonition} F280013x Device Family
This lab is not applicable to the F280013x device family since the F280013x
device family does not have a DMA module.

```

## Solution

All solutions are available 
in the directory: `[C2000Ware_Install_Path]/training/device/[device_name]`.

## Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Sysconfig GUI to generate a waveform with one of
the ePWM modules, like the PWM lab. Also like the PWM lab, the ADC will be
setup to sample the PWM waveform at a chosen sampling rate. At the end of each
conversion, however, the ADC will trigger the DMA rather than triggering an
interrupt on the CPU. 

The first time that the DMA is triggered will be the start of the
first 'Transfer'. Since we will have configured our DMA to generate an
interrupt at the start of 'Transfers', the DMA will immediately trigger an
interrupt before the first 'Burst' is sent. This very first interrupt should
set the DMA destination address to the Ping Buffer, while the CPU copies the
contents of the still empty Pong Buffer into a buffer called AdcBuf. During the
next interrupt, the destination address of the DMA will change to the Pong
Buffer, while the CPU copies from the Ping Buffer. Because we set
the 'Transfer' size of the DMA to be 50 'Bursts', the DMA interrupt will be
triggered on every 50th ADC conversion before the first 'Burst' of
the 'Transfer'. You can see the details of the interrupt in the dma_Ch1ISR code
block included later in the lab. 

You will be able to view the contents of any of these buffers in Code Composer
Studio (CCS). In this application, the DMA allows the CPU to reclaim
instruction cycles that would have been necessary to continuously copy data
from the ADC registers into memory, which allows for more instruction cycles to
be allocated for other tasks.

## Lab Setup

### Hardware Setup

You will need the following hardware for this lab:

* A C2000 controlCARD or LaunchPad with the supplied USB cable.
* Jumper cables.
* Oscilloscope (optional).

Use the supplied USB cable to connect the USB Micro or USB Mini Type-B
connector to the board. Connect the USB Standard Type-A connector into your
computer USB port. You should see some LEDs light up on your board. In addition
to powering the board, a JTAG communication link is also established between
the device and Code Composer Studio. Later in the lab we will be routing the
output pin of the PWM waveform to the input pin of the ADC, so make sure that
you have enough jumper cables to facilitate this.

### Software Setup

The following software will need to be installed on your computer:

* [Code Composer Studio](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO-C2000)
* [C2000Ware](https://www.ti.com/tool/C2000WARE)

## Import Empty project

Our first task is to import an empty project to our Code Composer
Studio (CCS) workspace. 
The basic instructions are as follows:

1. Open CCS and go to **Project→Import CCS Projects**. A new window should
   appear. Ensure that the **Select search-directory** option is activated.
2. Click the **Browse** button and select the
   `[C20000ware_Install_dir]/training/device/[device]/empty_lab`
   directory. 
   Note that the default Windows [C20000ware_Install_dir] is `C:/ti/c2000/C2000Ware_4_xx_xx_xx`.
3. Under **Discovered Projects**, you should now see the
   `lab_[board]_[device]` project. Select the appropriate project for either the control card or the launchpad. 
   
![Discovered_Projects](images/dma_lab/c2000_lab_epwm_ecap_start_small.png)
      
4. Click **Finish** to import and copy the `lab_[board]_[device]` project
   into your workspace.
5. Rename the project to your liking
   - "Right-click on the project in Project Explorer pane". Select 'Rename' from
      the drop down menu and rename the project to 'c2000_dma_lab' or a name of
      your choosing.
   - Now click the 'Down Arrow' located to the left of the imported project to
     expand it and select lab_main.c. Right-click on the file, and
     select 'Rename' to rename the file to c2000_dma_lab_main.c or a name of
     your choosing.

## Configure the GPIO

We will configure the necessary GPIO pins as shown below. Our PWM
waveform will be output from ePWM1A. We will also
configure one of the board LEDs as an indicator. 

### Steps to add GPIO configuration:

* In the project, open the `.syscfg` file by double-clicking it.
* Click '+' in GPIO to add GPIO line configuration for LED4. 
* Select GPIO number for your device and board from the table below.

Device  | LaunchPad           | controlCARD
--------|---------------------|-----------
F28379D |   Pin-66 (GPIO-31)  |  Pin-66 (GPIO-31)
F2838x  |   n/a               |  Pin-66 (GPIO-31)
F28004x |   Pin-81 (GPIO-23)  |  Pin-99(GPIO-31)
F28002x |   Pin-2 (GPIO-31)   |  Pin-2 (GPIO-31)
F28003x |   Pin-83(GPIO-22)   |  Pin-99(GPIO-31)

* The parameters should be filled like below.
    
![SYSCFG1](images/dma_lab/lab_gpio.png)
      

## Configure ePWM1 and ePWM2

```{admonition} For Devices F2837xD, F2837xS, F2838x, and F28003x:

The SYSCLK generated from the internal oscillator is higher than 100MHz on these
devices. This means that the EPWM clock for F28003x is 120MHz. The maximum EPWM
clock is still 100MHz on  F2837xD, F2837xS, and F2838x, but the ADC clock is
equal to the device SYSCLK. When clock dividers are selected in the following
modules, you may need to modify your dividers to achieve exactly the same
results.

You may also notice that your device has different parameters than the ones seen
in the images below. Do not worry, as all of the essential parameters for this
lab are available on all devices.

```

You may notice that the next sections are very similar to the ePWM lab, but be
careful, as the ADC configuration is slightly different. The code below
configures ePWM1A to output a 2kHz PWM waveform with a 25% duty cycle. This PWM
waveform will be used as a data input source. Notice that ePWM1A is setup to
output a symmetrical PWM waveform, that is, the time base counter is setup in
up/down mode. Given that we are in up/down mode and we want our PWM waveform to
have a frequency of 2kHz, we have

$\text{Time Base Period}=\frac{f_{tbclk}}{2f_{pwm}}=\frac{100* 10^6}{2* 2000}=25000.$

Next, we note the configuration of the duty cycle. Since we are in up/down mode
and we want our PWM waveform to have a 25% duty cycle, we have

$\text{Counter Compare Value}=(1-\frac{duty}{100})*tbprd=(1-\frac{25}{100})*25000=18750.$

The action qualifier submodule is then set to force the output to be high on a count up
event and low on a count down event. This results in the desired PWM waveform.

In this lab, the ADC will be used to sample the generated PWM waveform from
ePWM1A at a rate of 50kHz. The below code configures ePWM2 to trigger a SOC on
the ADC at a rate of 50kHz. Unlike ePWM1A, notice that ePWM2 is setup to
operate in up count mode, hence, we have

$\text{Time Base Period}=\frac{f_{tbclk}}{f_{pwm}}-1=\frac{100* 10^6}{50000}-1=1999.$
 
* To implement these specifications with SysConfig, first click the '+' by EPWM in the SysConfig screen to open an instance of the EPWM module.

![epwm_init](images/dma_lab/epwm_start_1.png)
  
* Expand the 'EPWM Time Base' dropdown menu, and apply the changes circled below. 
* Expand the 'EPWM Counter Compare' dropdown menu, and again apply the circled changes.

![EPWM1_1](images/dma_lab/lab_epwm1_1.png)
  
* Expand the 'EPWM Action Qualifier' dropdown menu, then apply the changes circled below. 

![EPWM1_2](images/dma_lab/lab_epwm1_2.png)
 
* Expand the 'ePWMxA Event Output Configuration' dropdown menu, then apply the changes circled below. 

![EPWM1_2](images/dma_lab/lab_epwm1_actions.png)
 
* Expand the 'PinMux Peripheral and Pin Configuration' dropdown menu. For 'EPWM
  Peripheral', make sure to select instance EPWM1. Also, make sure to
  select 'GPIO0' for 'EPWMA' and select 'GPIO1' for 'EPWMB', as shown below.
  The pin number will vary based on hardware.

![EPWM1_3](images/dma_lab/lab_epwm1_3.png)
 
* Now click the '+' by EPWM to open another instance of the EPWM module.

![epwm_init2](images/dma_lab/epwm_start_2.png)
  
* Expand the 'EPWM Time Base' dropdown menu, and apply the changes circled below. 

![EPWM2_1](images/dma_lab/lab_epwm2_1.png)
  
* Expand the 'EPWM Event-Trigger' dropdown menu, and apply the changes circled below. 

![EPWM2_2](images/dma_lab/lab_epwm2_2.png)
 
* Expand the 'PinMux Peripheral and Pin Configuration' dropdown menu, and apply
  the changes circled below. Also, make sure to select 'GPIO2' for 'EPWMA' and
  select 'GPIO3' for 'EPWMB', as shown below. The pin number will vary based on
  hardware. 

![EPWM2_3](images/dma_lab/lab_epwm2_3.png)
 

This concludes the configuration of the ePWM modules.

```{admonition} A more detailed explanation of the ePWM configuration
The configuration of both ePWM1A and ePWM2 above is identical to that of the
lab in [ePWM Lab](../../c2000_academy_labs/control_peripherals/c2000_lab_pwm.md),
so you should see that lab for a more detailed explanation.

```

## Configure the ADC

In the previous section, we explained that ePWM2 would be triggering a SOC
event on the ADC. In this section, we will provide the code to configure the
ADC. More details about the configuration of the ADC can be found in 
[Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)](../../c2000_analog_subsystem/c2000_analog_to_digital_converter.md).
However, notice that we have setup a SOC to be triggered by ePWM2 and that we
have setup the ADC to interrupt at the end of a conversion. This interrupt will
be utilized by the DMA so it knows when to load new samples from the ADC onto
the ping pong buffer. The ADC is also setup in continuous mode so that the ADC
register always contains the most recent sample.

* Add ADC by clicking the '+' by ADC in the SysConfig screen. Make sure to make
  the changes circled below. If your device SYSCLK is not 100MHz, you will need
  to change the ADC Clock Prescaler to acheive the same results. 
* For the 'SOC0 Sample Window[SYSCLK counts]' parameter, the same value may
  result in a different 'SOC0 Sample Time[ns]' on different devices, due to
  varying SYSCLK frequencies across devices. Make sure that the generated 'SOC0
  Sample Time[ns]' is about 80ns.

![ADC1](images/dma_lab/epwm_adc_1.png)
  
* Expand the 'ADC INT Configurations' dropdown menu, make the changes circled below. 

![ADC2](images/dma_lab/lab_adc_2.png)
 

```{admonition} For Devices F280025C, F280039C, F280049C, and F2800137:
Set analog reference voltage using asysctl parameter.

If the ADC module has already been added, select ASYSCTL in the ANALOG group 
and change the analog reference voltage to be an internal voltage of 2.5V. Otherwise, 
add ASYSCTL by clicking '+' in ANALOG group and then add internal 
reference of 2.5V.

![ASYSCTL](images/dma_lab/lab_adc_internal_ref.png)
```

## Configure the DMA

In this section, we will configure the DMA using SysConfig GUI tool. There are
two addresses which will be used during the configuration. These are source and
destination addresses. We will configure the trigger and mode of DMA channel 1.
The trigger for DMA channel 1 is set to be from ADCA1, which signals to the DMA
that a new sample is ready to be moved to the ping pong buffer. Notice that
one-shot mode has been disabled and continuous mode has been enabled.
Continuous mode ensures that the DMA is re-initialized after it completes a
full transfer, which is needed to continuously retrieve samples from the ADC,
otherwise, the DMA would halt. Additionally, notice that the word size is set
to be 16 bits. 

Click `+` next to DMA (in COMMUNICATION Group) to add DMA instance 

![DMA1](images/dma_lab/lab_dma1.png)
  

![DMA2](images/dma_lab/lab_dma2.png)
  

This concludes the configuration of the DMA.

## Configure CPUTIMER0

In this section, we provide the code to setup CPUTIMER0. This timer will be
used to capture the runtime of the DMA ISR. It is important that the runtime of
the DMA ISR does not exceed the product of the ADC sampling period with
`ADC_BUF_LEN` because this implies that the DMA will start to overwrite the
contents of next buffer. Notice how the timer period is set to be the maximum
value of the 32-bit counter. The system clock will be driving this counter at a
frequency of `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ`. 

Click `+` next to CPUTIMER (in SYSTEM Group) to add CPUTIMER instance 

![CPUTIMER](images/dma_lab/lab_cputimer.png)
  
 
## Define global macros and variables

First, we will define some necessary macros and global variables, and we will
configure the destination and source address of the DMA transfer. The global
variable `AdcBufRaw` points to a ping pong buffer of size `2*50` and type
`uint16_t`. Accordingly, the ping buffer is from offset `0` to `50/2-1` and the
pong buffer is from offset `ADC_BUF_LEN` to `2*50-1`. However, remembering that
the DMA only has access to GSx RAM, we use the `#pragma DATA_SECTION
(AdcBufRaw, "ramgs0")` line to tell the linker to place `AdcRawBuf` in GS0 RAM.
The section `ramgs0` should be included in the linker scripts provided by the
`empty_driver_lib` project template that we have used. Notice that we have set
the DMA channel 1 destination address to be `AdcBufRaw`, i.e., the ping buffer,
and that we have set the DMA channel 1 source address to be the register that
contains the samples from ADCINA0. In order to use driverlib, make sure that
you have included `driverlib.h` and `device.h` above these definitions. A
description of these macros and global variables will be addressed in the
following sections.

In your project, click on the `.c` file to open it, and add the following:

```
#define ADC_BUF_LEN 50              // Buffer length.
#pragma DATA_SECTION(AdcBufRaw, "ramgs0");
uint16_t AdcBufRaw[2*ADC_BUF_LEN];  // The Ping Pong buffer.
uint16_t AdcBuf[ADC_BUF_LEN];       // Buffer for CCS plotting.
uint16_t PingPongState = 0;         // Ping Pong buffer state.
uint16_t LedCtr = 0;                // Counter to slow LED toggling.
uint16_t TaskDelayUs = 0;           // Delay to simulate data processing task.
uint16_t OverCnt = 0;               // Counter to store DMA overwrites.
uint32_t TimDiff;                   // To measure the DMA ISR time.
const void* AdcAddr = (void*)(ADCARESULT_BASE + ADC_O_RESULT0);
const void* AdcRawBufAddr = (void*)AdcBufRaw;
```

## Define the DMA interrupt service routine

Lastly, we will write the ISR for DMA channel 1. The first task of this ISR is
to clear the necessary interrupt flags and initialize some local variables.
Notice that we also reset and start CPUTIMER0 to measure the runtime of this
ISR.

```
interrupt void dma_Ch1ISR(void)
{
    Interrupt_clearACKGroup(INTERRUPT_ACK_GROUP7);
    CPUTimer_startTimer(myCPUTIMER0_BASE);
    uint16_t *AdcBufPtr = AdcBuf;
    uint16_t *AdcBufRawPtr;
    uint16_t i;
```

Next, we will set up our indicator LED to toggle at a rate of 1Hz. It is
reasonable to assume that the DMA will be able to transfer words at the ADC
sampling rate, which is 50kHz. Thus, we know that this ISR is being called at a
rate of

$\frac{\text{sampling rate}}{\text{bursts per transfer}}=\frac{50000}{50}=1000\text{Hz}.$

Consequently, the global variable `LedCtr` is used as a counter to divide the
ISR call rate by 1000 in order to toggle the LED at a rate of 1Hz.

```
    if (LedCtr++ &gt;= 1000) {
        GPIO_togglePin(myGPIO0);
        LedCtr = 0;
    }
```

The ping pong buffer implemented in this lab is a type of double buffer that
allows the CPU to process one buffer of samples from the ADC while the DMA
fills the other buffer with new samples. As discussed in the last section, this
ISR will be triggered at the start of transfer on DMA channel 1. Thus, this ISR
must continuously alternate between the following states:

1. Process the **pong** buffer and set the DMA channel 1 destination address to
   point to the **ping** buffer.
2. Process the **ping** buffer and set the DMA channel 1 destination address to
   point to the **pong** buffer.

The global variable `PingPongState` is used as a state register. Note that
`PingPongState` is toggled in the ISR. In addition, note that our processing
step involves copying the contents of the ping or pong buffer into `AdcBuf`,
which is another buffer of size `ADC_BUF_LEN`. In the debug session, we will
use `AdcBuf` to view the ADC samples in real-time via the plotting capabilities
of CCS.

```
    if (PingPongState == 0) {
        // Set DMA address to start at ping buffer.
        DMA_configAddresses(DMA_CH1_BASE,
                            (const void *)AdcBufRaw,
                            (const void *)(ADCARESULT_BASE + ADC_O_RESULT0));
        // Fill AdcBuf with contents of the pong buffer.
        AdcBufRawPtr = AdcBufRaw + ADC_BUF_LEN;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; ADC_BUF_LEN; i++) { 
            *(AdcBufPtr++) = *(AdcBufRawPtr++);
        }
    } else {
        // Set DMA address to start at pong buffer.
        DMA_configAddresses(DMA_CH1_BASE,
                            (const void *)(AdcBufRaw + ADC_BUF_LEN),
                            (const void *)(ADCARESULT_BASE + ADC_O_RESULT0));
        // Fill AdcBuf with contents of the ping buffer.
        AdcBufRawPtr = AdcBufRaw;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; ADC_BUF_LEN; i++) {
            *(AdcBufPtr++) = *(AdcBufRawPtr++);
        }
    }
    PingPongState ^= 1;
```

In order to simulate more data processing, we add a delay that can be changed
via the global variable `TaskDelayUs`. We will change the value of
`TaskDelayUs` in real-time using the debug features of CCS.
```
    for (i = 0; i &lt; TaskDelayUs; i++) {
        DEVICE_DELAY_US(1);
    }
```

Finally, we stop the counter and calculate the elapsed time it took for the ISR
to complete. We can safely ignore the counter overflow in this case. To see
why, consider a system clock speed of 200 MHz—given that CPUTIMER0 is
32-bit, this would mean that CPUTIMER0 would overflow approximately every
21.5 seconds which is large enough for us to ignore. The number of counter
ticks that it takes for the ISR to complete is stored in `TimDiff`.

Since the DMA is triggering this ISR at a rate of 1000Hz as shown earlier, this
implies that the ISR duration cannot exceed 1ms, otherwise, the DMA will start
to overwrite the contents of the other buffer before the CPU has a chance to
read it. The number `0.001*DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ` is the approximate number of
counter ticks needed for a duration of 1ms. Accordingly, if we find that
`TimDiff` is greater than or equal to `0.001*DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ`, this implies
that the DMA has started overwriting the contents of the next buffer.
If this is the case, we increment the global variable `OverCnt`, which stores
the number of times the ISR runtime exceeds 1ms. We can view `OverCnt` in
real-time via the debug features of CCS.

```
    CPUTimer_stopTimer(myCPUTIMER0_BASE);
    TimDiff = 0xFFFFFFFF - CPUTimer_getTimerCount(myCPUTIMER0_BASE);
    if (TimDiff &gt;= ((uint32_t)(0.001*DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ))) {
        OverCnt++;
    }
}
```

```{admonition} DMA Buffer Overwriting Fix
If you find that the ISR is taking too long to complete and the DMA is overwriting 
the next buffer, try increasing the buffer size and/or decreasing the ADC sample 
rate. Both of these changes will slow down the DMA and give the CPU more time to 
process data.

```

## Define main()

Next, we will populate `main` as shown below. 
That being said, we still need to know the system clock frequency in order to
configure the ePWM modules necessary for this lab. The system clock frequency
value that is configured via `Device_init()` is defined as `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ`
in `[projectroot]/device/device.h`. Observe that the main function only handles
initialization routines. Most of the activity in this lab will lie in the DMA
interrupt service routine.

```
void main(void)
{
    Device_init();
    Interrupt_initModule();
    Interrupt_initVectorTable();
    Board_init();
    EINT;
    ERTM;
    for(;;) {
        NOP;
    }
}
```

This concludes the coding portion of this lab.

## Build and run interactive debug session

1. Ensure that the USB cable from your LaunchPad or controlCARD is connected to
   your computer. If you have a LaunchPad, right click on your project in the
   project explorer pane and click **Properties→Build→C2000
   Compiler→Predefined Symbols**, add `_LAUNCHXL_F28XXXXX` as a predefined
   symbol according to your `device.h` header file. The `device.h` file can be
   found in the `[projectroot]/device/` directory.
2. Under the **Build** button, activate the **CPU1_RAM** build configuration.
   Use the **CPU1_LAUNCHXL_RAM** build configuration if it is available and if
   you are using a LaunchPad. Build the program and fix any compilation errors.
3. Create a new debug configuration. Set the target configuration to be
   `${[workspace_loc]:/[projectroot]/targetConfigs/TMS320F28XXXXX_LaunchPad.ccxml}`
   if using a LaunchPad, else, use
   `${[workspace_loc]:/[projectroot]/targetConfigs/TMS320F28XXXXX.ccxml}`.
   Select the current project to be loaded to **CPU1**. Press **Apply** and close
   the window.
4. Connect the ePWM1A GPIO pin to the ADCINA0 GPIO pin using a jumper cable. If
   you have an oscilloscope, connect a probe to the ePWM1A GPIO pin on your
   board.

**LaunchPad**

Device  | ADCINA0 Pin | EPWM1A Pin
--------|-------------|-----------
F28379D |   30        |  40
F2838x  |   n/a       |  n/a
F28004x |   70        |  80
F28003x |   70        |  40

**ControlCARD**

Device  | ADCINA0 Pin | EPWM1A Pin
--------|-------------|-----------
F28379D |   9         |  49
F2838x  |   9         |  49
F28004x |   9         |  49
F28003x |   9         |  49
   
5. Now we will start the debug session. Under the debug button, start the debug
   session using the new configuration. You should now see the debugging
   session open up and the debugger should have reached `main()`.
6. Click the **Resume** button. You should see the LED on your board toggling
   at about 1Hz which indicates that the DMA ISR is being called at 1000Hz as
   expected.
7. Next, we will check the ping pong buffer. In the memory browser, search for
   the address `&amp;AdcBufRaw`. Enable **Continuous Refresh** and ensure that you
   are viewing the memory in 16-bit hexadecimal. Watch the memory browser
   update in real-time. If all is well, you should notice that `AdcBufRaw`
   occupies 100 16-bit memory locations and roughly 25% percent of the
   locations have a value of `0x0FFF` while the others contain something close
   to `0x0000`. This suggests that the DMA is transferring the ADC samples
   correctly into the ping pong buffer and the DMA ISR is correctly alternating
   the DMA channel 1 destination address pointer between the ping and pong
   buffers at the start of a transfer.

![Memory Browser](images/dma_lab/memory_browser.png)
   
8. Now we will view the sampled PWM waveform in real-time using `AdcBuf`. Click
   on **Tools→Graph→Single Time**, set **Acquisition Buffer Size** to
   be **50**, set **Dsp Data Type** to be **16 bit unsigned integer**, set
  **Sampling Rate Hz** to be **50000**, set **Start Address** to be
  **AdcBuf**, set **Time Display Unit** to be **us**, and leave the other
   settings as their default value. Click **OK** and you should see the plot
   window open up. Activate the **Continuous Refresh** option in the plot
   window. You should now see several periods of the PWM waveform in the plot
   updating in real-time. If desired, you can use the measurement tool to
   verify that the duty cycle is 25% and the period is 500us. Leave the plot
   window open.

```{admonition} Important
   Note: If you do not see CCS menu **Tools → Graph**, please refer to 
   [Getting Started (Setting CCS for graph)](../../c2000_get_started/c2000_getstarted.md)

```

![Plot Configuration](images/dma_lab/plot_setup.png)

![PWM Waveform](images/dma_lab/plot_pwm.png)

9. Finally, we will experiment with different values of delay in the DMA ISR.
   Add `OverCnt`, `TimDiff`, and `TaskDelayUs` to the watch expression list and
   enable **Continuous Refresh**. Play with different values of `TaskDelayUs`
   from 0–1000. Observe the changes in `OverCnt` and `TimDiff`. At some point, 
   you will find a value closer to 1000 that will cause `OverCnt` to start to increment, 
   which implies that the
   DMA is overwriting the contents of the next buffer. Even though the DMA is
   overwriting the next buffer, notice that the plot window appears to be
   unaffected. This is because the waveform we are viewing is periodic, thus,
   subsequent buffers will all contain the same information. However, if we
   were viewing an aperiodic waveform, we would be able to observe
   discontinuities and other artifacts in the signal due to the DMA overwriting
   the next buffer.
10. Terminate the debug session and close the project. This concludes the lab
    assignment.

# eCAP Implementation Using CLB

The objective of this lab is to gain more advanced skill with the Configurable
Logic Block (CLB) peripheral and its submodules through a guided example. The
scenario in this lab consists of implementing an eCAP module, or a capture
module, using parts of the CLB. This demonstration showcases the CLB's ability
to connect to a signal, accurately time events, and send data to the CPU. The
CLB will measure a high signal, a low signal, and another high signal before
sending the data to the CPU. An external wave generator or the ePWM module can
be set up to supply a signal, if a wave generator is not available.

## Solution

All solutions are available in the directory: 
`<c2000ware_install_path>/training/device/<device_name>`.

## Introduction

This lab demonstrates how a CLB tile can be used to implement the same basic 
functionality as an eCAP peripheral. The CLB will use edge filtering to create
events where counters can start and stop, and data can be pushed to the CPU. The
purpose of this is to simulate an eCAP with its basic features.

An eCAP operates by measuring the time between two signal transitions using a
counter. This peripheral can measure the time between two high pulses, two low
pulses, a low and a high pulse, and a high and a low pulse. The CLB, because it
has a counter and methods of triggering events, can therefore be used in much
the same way.

## Lab Setup

### Hardware Setup

You will need the following hardware for this lab:

* A C2000 controlCARD or LaunchPad with the supplied USB cable.
* 1 Jumper cable (optional).
* Waveform generator. (optionally available to use ePWM instead of waveform generator)

Use the supplied USB cable to connect the USB Micro or USB Mini Type-B
connector to the board. Connect the USB Standard Type-A connector into your
computer USB port. You should see some LEDs light up on your board. In addition
to powering the board, a JTAG communication link is also established between
the device and Code Composer Studio. Later in the lab, the sensor GPIO pin will 
be routed to either GND or 3.3V, so ensure you have a jumper cable. An 
oscilloscope is optional, but will allow the ePWM output to be viewed through 
GPIO0.

### Software Setup

The following software will need to be installed on your computer:

* [Code Composer Studio](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO-C2000)
* [C2000Ware](https://www.ti.com/tool/C2000WARE)

## Create a new CCS project

```{admonition} Alternative Method for CLB Peripheral
Within C2000Ware, the CLB example folder contains its own example project which 
can be imported into CCS. This CLB example project automatically includes 
additional library files which are necessary for the CLB's operation. It also 
initializes and enables CLB1 by default. This project is titled `clb_empty` and 
can be found at `C:/ti/c2000/C2000Ware_X_XX_00_00/driverlib/<devicename>/examples/clb/CCS`.
To use this method, follow the steps below, substituting the `clb_empty` 
project in place of the `empty_sysconfig_xxx` project.

```

Our first task is to create an empty driverlib project in our Code Composer 
Studio (CCS) workspace. The basic instructions are as follows:

* Open CCS and go to **Project→Import CCS Projects**. A new window should 
appear. Ensure that the **Select search-directory** option is activated.
* Click the **Browse** button and select the `C:/ti/c2000/C2000Ware_X_XX_00_00/driverlib/<devicename>/examples/pinmux/CCS` 
directory. Note that we assume the default Windows C2000Ware install path. If 
you have a dual core device, select the `C:/ti/c2000/C2000Ware_X_XX_00_00/driverlib/<devicename>/examples/cpu1/pinmux/CCS` 
directory instead.
* Under **Discovered Projects**, you should now see the `empty_sysconfig_xxx` 
project with different device pin options. Select the project with the correct 
pin count from the list of "Discovered Projects". For the various LaunchPads 
and ControlCARDs the recommended projects are outlined below based on the 
device.

Device  | Project                  
--------|--------------------------
F28379D |   empty_sysconfig_337zwt    
F2838x  |   empty_sysconfig_337bga 
F28004x |   empty_sysconfig_100pz   
F28002x |   empty_sysconfig_80qfp      
F28003x |   empty_sysconfig_100pz   

* Click **Finish** to import and copy the `empty_sysconfig_xxx` project into 
your workspace.
* Rename the project to your liking
   - Right-click on the project in Project Explorer pane. Select 'Rename' 
   from dropdown menu and rename the project to 'module13_clb_ecap_sysconfig' or a 
   name of your choosing.
   - Now click the 'Down Arrow' located to the left of the imported project to 
   expand it and select empty_sysconfig_xxxx.c. Right-click on the file, and 
   select 'Rename' to rename the file to a name of your choosing.

## Task 1 - Configure LED Output

* Select the GPIO number from the "Hardware" tab in SysConfig.
* Click '+' in GPIO to add GPIO line configuration for LED4 (myBoardLED0_GPIO). The parameters should be filled like below.
      
![SYSCFG1](images/clb_lab/sysconfig_board_led.png)
        
## Task 2 - Setting up the GPIO (Optional)

We will begin this lab exercise by configuring the required GPIO within the 
`c2000.syscfg` file of the project. Double-click the `c2000.syscfg` file within 
the project to open the SysConfig GUI. Only one GPIO will be needed for 
this lab, and it will serve as the external signal source.

Within SysConfig, perform the following steps:
- Add a GPIO by clicking the (+) icon next to 'GPIO' on the left pane
- Set the GPIO as an input
- Set the Pin Type as "Push-pull output/floating input"

Now, we have to choose which GPIO we are configuring. Upon 
expanding the "PinMux" view we can choose the desired GPIO. Follow the steps 
below:
- Click on the three dot icon at the top right of the SysConfig window
- Select "Preferences &amp; Actions"
- Under preferences, click on the 'Device Pin Label' drop down arrow
and enable "Device pin name". This is not part of the default
SysConfig settings but allows us to see the pin name along with the 
pin number
- Within the GPIO PinMux, select the desired GPIO (see table below)

Device  | LaunchPad   | controlCARD
--------|-------------|-----------
F28379D |   58        |  40
F2838x  |   n/a       |  40
F28004x |   58        |  34
F28002x |   42        |  39
F28003x |   48        |  40

![SysConfig External GPIO](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_gpio.png)

To be able to use the GPIO as a CLB input, we need to route the GPIO as an 
auxiliary signal (AUXSIG) through the global input bus. This requires using the 
input crossbar (INPUTXBAR) and CLB crossbar (CLBXBAR). First, configure the 
Input X-BAR to connect the GPIO to `INPUTXBAR1` using the steps below:
- Add Input X-BAR by clicking the (+) icon next to 'INPUTXBAR' on the left pane
- Select INPUTXBAR1 as the Input X-BAR instance to be used
- Configure INPUTXBAR1 to use the specified GPIO
- If desired, check the box to lock INPUTXBAR1

![SysConfig Input X-BAR](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_inputxbar.png)

Next, the CLB X-BAR needs to be configured to route INPUTXBAR1 as an auxiliary 
signal into the CLB. Configure the CLB X-BAR to route `INPUTXBAR1` to `AUXSIG0` 
using the steps below:
- Add a CLB X-BAR instance by clicking the (+) icon next to 'CLBXBAR' on the 
left pane
- Select AUXSIG0 as the Aux Signal Input
- Select MUX 01 as the MUX to be used for this AUXSIG0. MUX 01 is a requirement 
as it provides a connection to the INPUTXBAR1 signal
- In the MUX 1 dropdown, configure INPUTXBAR1 to be used

![SysConfig CLB X-BAR](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_clbxbar.png)

Now, the GPIO has been successfully configured as AUXSIG0 on the 
global input bus and can be used as an input into the CLB.

## Task 3 - Initialize the EPWM Module

The EPWM module will be used to represent an external signal, and is configured to be a 
2kHz PWM waveform with a 50% duty cycle on ePWM1A (NOTE: here the system clock is
set to 100 MHz, see ePWM section for calculating frequency from time base period). 
For more information on the PWM, please review the Control Peripherals module.

We will start by adding a PWM instance within Sysconfig by clicking on the (+) 
sign next to 'EPWM' within the left pane of Sysconfig. Name this EPWM instance 
'myEPWM1'. Now that we have added an EPWM instance, we will configure the EPWM1 
'Timebase' submodule as follows:

- Set **High Speed Clock Divider** to 'Divide clock by 1'
- Set **Time Base Period** to '25000'
- Set **Counter Mode** to 'Up - down - count mode'

![SysConfig EPWM Part 1](images/clb_lab/syscfg_epwm_pt1.png)

The 'Counter Compare' submodule for EPWM1A will be as follows:
- Set **Counter Compare A (CMPA)** to '12500'

![SysConfig EPWM Part 2](images/clb_lab/syscfg_epwm_pt2.png)

Now, configure the 'Action Qualifier' submodule for EPWM1A as follows:
- Enable Shadow Mode
- Set **Shadow Load Event** to 'Load when counter equals zero'
- In **Events to Configure for ePWMxA output**, select 'Time base counter up 
equals COMPA' and 'Time base counter down equals COMPA'
- Set **Time base counter up equals COMPA** to 'Set output pins to High'
- Set **Time base counter down equals COMPA** to 'Set output pins to Low'

![SysConfig EPWM Part 3](images/clb_lab/syscfg_epwm_pt3.png)

Lastly, we need to configure the PinMux for EPWM1A. Even though the output of 
ePWM1A will be overridden by the output of the CLB, configuring the output GPIO 
is good practice as it allows us to view the pure ePWM1A pulse for debugging 
purposes. Follow the steps below:
- Select 'CUSTOM' on the EPWM1 PinMux. This allows us to select only EPWM_A as 
an output
- Configure the Pin as 'EPWM_A'
- Set the EPWM Peripheral to be used as 'EPWM1'
- Configure the 'EPWM_A' pin to be 'GPIO0'

![SysConfig EPWM Part 4](images/clb_lab/syscfg_epwm_pt4.png)

## Task 4 - Setup the CLB

To setup the CLB peripheral, we need to add a CLB instance within SysConfig. We 
will need to setup this CLB instance to use the external signal as an input. 
We must also attach an interrupt handler to this CLB instance so that the HLC 
can issue interrupts to the CPU to send data. Setup CLB1 by following the steps below:
- Add a CLB by clicking the (+) icon next to 'CLB' on the left pane
- Set the CLB Instance to be 'CLB1'
- Select 'Input 0', 'Input 1', and 'Input 2' as Inputs Used for CLB1

![SysConfig CLB Peripheral](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_clb_header.png)

Now we will route the GPIO input into Input 0 of CLB1. Doing this allows us 
to select AUXSIG0 as an input into CLB1. Configure Input 0 as follows:
- Set the Input type as 'Use Global Mux'
- Under the dropdown for Global Mux Input, select 'CLB X-BAR AUXSIG0'
- No syncing, input syncing, or initial GPREG writes are necessary

![SysConfig CLB Input 0](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_input0.png)

Next, we will route the GPIO input into Input 1 of CLB1. Configure 
Input 1 as follows:
- Set the Input type as 'Use Global Mux'
- Under the dropdown for Global Mux Input, select 'CLB X-BAR AUXSIG0'
- Set the Input Filter to be Rising edge detect and enable synchronization

![SysConfig CLB Input 1](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_input1.png)

Finally, we will route the GPIO input into Input 2 of CLB1. Configure 
Input 2 as follows:
- Set the Input type as 'Use Global Mux'
- Under the dropdown for Global Mux Input, select 'CLB X-BAR AUXSIG0'
- Set the Input Filter to be Falling edge detect and enable synchronization

![SysConfig CLB Input 1](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_input2.png)

Because the HLC submodule within CLB1 will be issuing interrupts to the CPU 
when a fault is detected, an Interrupt Handler must be configured. Follow the 
steps below to do this:
- Check the box next to 'Register Interrupt Handler'
- Rename the Interrupt Handler function as desired
- Check the box next to 'Enable Interrupt in PIE'
- Verify that the Initialize TILE checkbox is selected

![SysConfig CLB Interrupt](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clbinterrupt.png)

## Task 5 - Configure the CLB Tile

Now it is time to configure the CLB1 tile to perform the logic necessary to 
implement an eCAP and send data to the CPU.

Navigate to the 'TILE' peripheral within the SysConfig GUI and add a single 
TILE instance. Alternatively, you can add a tile by selecting the "Attach a TILE 
Config to this CLB" checkbox. Begin the CLB tile configuration by editing LUT_0. 
LUT_0 will be responsible for creating an enable for the counter when the signal is 
low. Configure LUT_0 as follows:
- Select 'BOUNDARY.in0' as the input for i0. This corresponds to the external signal
- In the equation field, enter the following logical expression: `!i0`
   - With this logic, the output of LUT_0 will be the inverse of the external signal.

![SysConfig LUT0](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_lut0.png)

LUT_1 will be responsible for detecting the first high signal of a square wave. 
The output of this LUT will be used as an event trigger by the HLC so that the counter 
can store the time of the first high pulse. Configure LUT_1 as follows:
- Select 'FSM_0.S0' as the input for i0. This corresponds to the state where the first 
high pulse occurs in the square wave.
- Select 'BOUNDARY.in2' as the input for i1. This corresponds to the event where a falling 
edge occurs, or in other words the end of the high pulse.
- In the equation field, enter the following logical expression: `i0&amp;i1`
   - The result of this logic is that an event will be triggered in the HLC when the FSM
   detects the 'first' high pulse of a wave and the pulse has just fallen low

![SysConfig LUT1](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_lut1.png)

LUT_2 will be responsible for detecting the second high signal of a square wave. 
The output of this LUT will be used as an event trigger by the HLC so that the counter 
can store the time of the first high pulse. Configure LUT_2 as follows:
- Select 'FSM_0.S1' as the input for i0. This corresponds to the state where the second 
high pulse occurs in the square wave.
- Select 'BOUNDARY.in2' as the input for i1. This corresponds to the event where a falling 
edge occurs, or in other words the end of the high pulse.
- In the equation field, enter the following logical expression: `i0&amp;i1`
- The result of this logic is that an event will be triggered in the HLC when the FSM
detects the 'second' high pulse of a wave and the pulse has just fallen low

![SysConfig LUT2](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_lut2.png)

Now we must configure FSM_0 to transition between states that divide a signal so 
that there is a first and second high signal that can be distinguished:
- Set 'BOUNDARY.in1' as the input, which is the rising edge detect input.
- Set the equation for S0 as s0^e0 (^ = XOR). This logic dictates that S0 will be true 
when the first high pulse is occurring (S0 indicates the first high pulse), the 
rising edge has occurred, but not both/neither.
- Set the equation for S1 as !(s0^e0). This logic states that S1 will be true 
when either a rising edge and the first high pulse is occurring simultaneously, or 
neither are occurring. S1 indicates the second high pulse.
- In the output equation field, enter the following logical expression: `s0`

![SysConfig FSM 0](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_fsm.png)

Next are the counters. Two counters will be used for this lab, one to count the 
length of time the signal is high, the other to count when it is low. COUNTER_0 will 
count up when the signal is high, and reset when a rising edge occurs. Because 
it is measuring between rising edges and only counting when the signal is high, 
it will only measure the length of the high pulse:

![SysConfig Counter 0](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_counter0.png)

COUNTER_1 will measure the length of time the signal is low. This counter counts 
when the inverse of the signal (from LUT_0) is high and resets on a falling edge. 
This measures between falling edges and only counts the time when the inverse of 
the signal is high, thereby only measuring the times the actual signal is low:

![SysConfig Counter 1](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_counter1.png)

Finally, the High-Level Controller is configured with three events. 
- Event 0 is triggered by the **first high pulse** of the sensor input and will 
load the value from COUNTER_0 into the R0 register.
- Event 1 is triggered by the **low pulse** of the sensor input and will 
load the value from COUNTER_1 into the R1 register.
- Event 2 is triggered by the **second high pulse** of the sensor input and will 
load the value from COUNTER_0 into the R2 register. Then the registers are pushed 
and an interrupt is triggered so the CPU may read the data. The interrupt is triggered 
here so that the first high pulse, low pulse, and second high pulse are sent to the 
CPU without missing or overwriting data.

Configure the HLC as follows:
- Select 'LUT_1.OUT' as the trigger condition for Event 0
- Select 'BOUNDARY.in1' as the trigger condition for Event 1
- Select 'LUT_2.OUT' as the trigger condition for Event 2
   <!-- - Alternatively, on devices with CLB Type 2 or later, select 'BOUNDARY.in1_INVERTED' -->
- In the fields for the HLC programs, enter the instructions as shown in the images below

![SysConfig HLC](images/clb_lab/syscfg_clb_ecap_hlc.png)

## Task 6 - Setup the CLB ISR

Now that we have configured the CLB module within SysConfig, we can 
switch to the application code portion of this lab. Within the project click on 
the .c file under the name you chose. 
Within the .c file, we need to write the ISR (interrupt service routine).

The first thing that will be done in the interrupt is reading the pushed registers 
via the read FIFO function.

Note: The name of the ISR function is what we defined earlier within the 
SysConfig configuration for the CLB.

```
__interrupt void INT_myCLB0_ISR(void)
{
    CLB_readFIFOs(myCLB0_BASE, (uint32_t *)regPush);
```

A GPIO pin will be toggled upon reaching a certain counter value of a global 
variable. This is to show that the ISR is triggering properly. Lastly, we 
must acknowledge the PIE group as well as clear the interrupt status 
flag so that we can continue to service interrupts in the future. 

```
   //
   // Toggle the GPIO pins; increase from 1000 to slow down the toggle
   //
   ledCount = (ledCount + 1) % (1000);
   if(ledCount == 0)
   {
      if(gpioStatus)
      {
         gpioStatus = 0;
      }
      else
      {
         gpioStatus = 1;
      }
      GPIO_writePin(myBoardLED0_GPIO, gpioStatus);
   }
   CLB_clearInterruptTag(myCLB0_BASE);
   Interrupt_clearACKGroup(INT_myCLB0_INTERRUPT_ACK_GROUP);
}
```

## Task 7 - Setup the .c file

The last thing we have to do is define any variables we are using throughout 
the project and setup the content within the main() function, which includes 
device initialization.

We begin by including the basic necessary libraries `driverlib.h` and `device.
h`. Next, include the SysConfig-generated header file `board.h`. This should 
already be included by default. Lastly, include the `clb_config.h` and `clb.h` 
libraries, which are required for proper CLB function. These two CLB libraries 
are included by default if the `clb_empty` project was imported.

```
//
// Included Files
//
#include "driverlib.h"
#include "device.h"
#include "board.h"
```

Then we define the global variables that will be used.

```
//
// Global variables and definitions
//
volatile float32_t frequency = 0.0;
volatile float32_t period = 0.0;
volatile float32_t duty = 0.0;
volatile float32_t timesHLH[3];
volatile uint32_t regPush[4];
volatile uint16_t ledCount = 0;
//Flag to save current state of GPIO
uint16_t  gpioStatus = 0;
```

Next we declare the interrupt functions used.

```
//
// Functions
//
__interrupt void INT_myCLB0_ISR(void);
__interrupt void INT_myECAP0_ISR(void);
```

Lastly, we define the contents within main() which includes device 
initialization and peripheral setup:

```
void main(void)
{
   //
   // CPU Initialization
   //
   Device_init();
   Device_initGPIO();
   Interrupt_initModule();
   Interrupt_initVectorTable();
   Board_init();
   //
   // Enable global interrupts and real-time debug
   //
   EINT;
   ERTM;
   //
   // Local variables
   //
   uint32_t clockFreq = DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ;
   uint32_t firstHighCLB = 0;
   uint32_t firstLowCLB = 0;
   uint32_t secondHighCLB = 0;
	while(1)
	{
      //
      // Frequency, period, duty, and other timing calculations
      // NOTE: 1 is added to each count because of zero-indexing counter
      //
      firstHighCLB = regPush[0] + 1;
      firstLowCLB = regPush[1] + 1;
      secondHighCLB = regPush[2] + 1;
      frequency = (float32_t)(clockFreq) / ((float32_t)(firstHighCLB + firstLowCLB));
      period = 1 / frequency;
      timesHLH[0] = (float32_t)(firstHighCLB) / (float32_t)(clockFreq);
      timesHLH[1] = (float32_t)(firstLowCLB) / (float32_t)(clockFreq);
      timesHLH[2] = (float32_t)(secondHighCLB) / (float32_t)(clockFreq);
      duty = timesHLH[0] * frequency * 100;
	}
}
```

This concludes the coding portion of this lab.

## Running the Lab

### Build and Run Interactive Debug Session

* Ensure that the USB cable from your LaunchPad or controlCARD is connected to
   your computer. If you have a LaunchPad, right click on your project in the
   project explorer pane and click **Properties→Build→C2000
   Compiler→Predefined Symbols**, add `_LAUNCHXL_F28XXXXX` as a predefined
   symbol according to your `device.h` header file. The `device.h` file can be
   found in the `<projectroot>/device/` directory.
* Under the **Build** button, activate the **CPU1_RAM** build configuration.
   Use the **CPU1_LAUNCHXL_RAM** build configuration if it is available and if
   you are using a LaunchPad. Build the program and fix any compilation errors.
* Create a new debug configuration. Set the target configuration to be
   `${workspace_loc:/<projectroot>/targetConfigs/TMS320F28XXXXX_LaunchPad.ccxml}`
   if using a LaunchPad, else, use
   `${workspace_loc:/<projectroot>/targetConfigs/TMS320F28XXXXX.ccxml}`.
   Select the current project to be loaded to **CPU1**. Press **Apply** and 
   close the window.
* Prior to running the lab, ensure that a jumper cable is connected between 
the GPIO pin and the ePWM input (or optionally the waveform generator).

**LaunchPad**

Device  | GPIO Pin   | EPWM1A Pin
--------|------------|-----------
F28379D |   58       |  40
F2838x  |   n/a      |  n/a
F28004x |   58       |  80
F28002x |   42       |  40
F28003x |   48       |  40

**ControlCARD**

Device  | GPIO Pin   | EPWM1A Pin
--------|------------|-----------
F28379D |   40       |  49
F2838x  |   40       |  49
F28004x |   34       |  49
F28002x |   39       |  49
F28003x |   40       |  49


* Now we will start the debug session. Under the debug button, start the debug
   session using the new configuration. You should now see the debugging
   session open up and the debugger should have reached `main()`.
* Click the **Resume** button. 

### Observe the Lab

* For this lab, you can monitor the global variables such as frequency, period,
or duty to verify the signal you are inputting is being read correctly by the 
CLB eCAP.

* Try to enter in different values to experiment with the range of frequencies that can 
be used and detected by the system. Low frequencies are limited only by the size of the 
counter, whereas high frequencies are limited by the system's speed.

Terminate the debug session and close the project. This concludes the lab 
assignment.

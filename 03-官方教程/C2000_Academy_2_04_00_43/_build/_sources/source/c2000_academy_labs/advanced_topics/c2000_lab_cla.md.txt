# Control Law Accelerator (CLA) Lab

The Control Law Accelerator (CLA) is an independent 32-bit floating-point math 
hardware accelerator which executes realtime control algorithms in parallel 
with the main C28x CPU. In this lab, the user will learn how to configure CLA 
to read the ADC sample data and then apply FIR filter to ADC sample. At the end 
it will send raw ADC sample data and filter outout to C28x code for further 
processing using Cla1ToCpuMsgRAM message RAM.


```{admonition} Note:
This lab cannot be performed on the following device/s since there is no CLA:
* F28002x
* F280013x
* F280015x

```

## Solutions

All solutions are available in the directory: `<c2000ware_install_path>/training/device/<device_name>`.  

## Introduction

In this lab, we will use the Control Law Accelerator (CLA) to implement a FIR
lowpass filter. We will apply a PWM waveform to the input of our lowpass
filter, which will result in a sinusoidal waveform at the output. The PWM
waveform will be generated using one of the ePWM modules and it will be sampled
via the ADC at a given sample rate. Both the filtered and unfiltered waveforms
will be viewed in a real-time Code Composer Studio (CCS) debug session via
internal buffers.

## Lab Setup

### Hardware Setup

You will need the following hardware for this lab:
 * A C2000 controlCARD or LaunchPad with the supplied USB cable.
 * Jumper cables.
 * Oscilloscope (optional).

Use the supplied USB cable to connect your C2000 board's USB port to the standard 
USB Type-A connector in your computer. You should see some LEDs light up on your 
board. In addition to powering the board, a JTAG communication link is also 
established between the device and Code Composer Studio. 

Later in the lab we will be routing the
output pin of the PWM waveform to the input pin of the ADC, so make sure that
you have enough jumper cables to facilitate this.

### Software Setup

The following software will need to be installed on your computer:
* [Code Composer Studio](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO-C2000)
* [C2000Ware](https://www.ti.com/tool/C2000WARE)

## Import Empty Project

Our first task is to import an empty project to our Code Composer
Studio (CCS) workspace. 
The basic instructions are as follows:

1. Open CCS and go to **Project→Import CCS Projects**. A new window should
   appear. Ensure that the **Select search-directory** option is activated.
2. Click the **Browse** button and select the
   `[C20000ware_Install_dir]/training/device/[device]/empty_cla_lab`
   directory. 
   Note that the default Windows [C20000ware_Install_dir] is 
   `C:/ti/c2000/C2000Ware_4_xx_xx_xx`.
3. Under **Discovered Projects**, you should now see the
   `lab_[board]_[device]` project. Select the appropriate project for either 
   the control card or the launchpad. 
   
![Discovered_Projects](images/cla_lab/cla_start.png)
      
4. Click **Finish** to import and copy the `lab_cla_[board]_[device]` project
   into your workspace.
5. After the project has been imported, the project explorer window should 
   look like below:
   
![Projects_explorer](images/cla_lab/cla_project_view.png)
     
   * <b>lab_main.c</b>: C28x core C-source file with empty main() function
   * <b>lab_cla_tasks.cla</b>: CLA core source file 
   * <b>lab_shared.h</b>: Common symbols defined here and they are used by 
     both cores.


## Configure the GPIO

We will configure the necessary GPIO pins as shown below. Our PWM
waveform will be output from ePWM1A. We will also
configure one of the board LEDs as an indicator. 

### Steps to add GPIO configuration:

* In the project, open the `.syscfg` file by double-clicking it.
* In the SysConfig GUI, select the "Hardware" tab, as shown below.

![lab_cla_led](images/cla_lab/lab_cla_led.png)
  

* If you have a Launchpad, click '+' to add LED5. If you have a controlCard, click '+' to add D2. 

* Select the LED option like below.

![lab_cla_led2](images/cla_lab/lab_cla_led2.png)
  
      
## Configure ePWM1 and ePWM2

The code below configures ePWM1A to output a 1kHz PWM waveform with a 50% duty
cycle. This PWM waveform will be used as the input to our FIR lowpass filter.
Notice that ePWM1A is setup to output a symmetrical PWM waveform, that is, the
time base counter is setup in up/down mode. Given that we are in up/down mode
and we want our PWM waveform to have a frequency of 1kHz, we have

$\text{Time Base Period}=\frac{f_{tbclk}}{2f_{pwm}}=\frac{100* 10^6}{2* 1000}=50000.$

Notice that the macro `PWM_HALF_PERIOD` is set accordingly to be 50000.

```{admonition} On the frequency of the ePWM clock
If you have a F2837xD or F2838x based device, the ePWM clock frequency is half
of `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ` by default, otherwise, `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ` and the
ePWM clock frequency are equal. The code provided in this lab results in the
ePWM clock being 100MHz.

```

Next, we note the configuration of the duty cycle. Since we are in up/down mode
and we want our PWM waveform to have a 50% duty cycle, we have

$\text{Counter Compare Value}=(1-\frac{duty}{100}) *tbprd=(1-\frac{50}{100})*50000=25000.$

Notice that the macro `PWM_DUTY` is set accordingly to be 25000. The action
qualifier sub-module is then set to force the output to be high on a count up
event and low on a count down event. This results in the desired PWM waveform.  
  
Add EPWM by clicking '+' in SysConfig screen to add EPWM1.

![EPWM1_1](images/cla_lab/lab_epwm1_1.png)
  

![EPWM1_3](images/cla_lab/lab_epwm1_2.png)
  

![EPWM1_4](images/cla_lab/lab_epwm1_3.png)
  

![EPWM1_2](images/cla_lab/lab_epwm1_4.png)
 

In this lab, the ADC will be used to sample the generated PWM waveform from
ePWM1A at a rate of 8kHz. The below code configures ePWM2 to trigger a SOC on
the ADC at a rate of 8kHz. Unlike ePWM1A, notice that ePWM2 is setup to operate
in up count mode, hence, we have

$\text{Time Base Period}=\frac{f_{tbclk}}{f_{pwm}}-1=\frac{100* 10^6}{8000}-1=12499.$

Accordingly, the macro `ADC_SAMPLE_PERIOD` is set to be 12499.  

Now press 'Add' button to add EPWM2.

![EPWM2_1](images/cla_lab/lab_epwm2_1.png)
  

![EPWM2_3](images/cla_lab/lab_epwm2_2.png)
 

![EPWM2_2](images/cla_lab/lab_epwm2_3.png)
 

This concludes the configuration of the ePWM modules.

```{admonition} A more detailed explanation of the ePWM configuration
The configuration of both ePWM1A and ePWM2 above is identical to that of the
lab in 
[ePWM Lab](../../c2000_academy_labs/control_peripherals/c2000_lab_pwm.md),
so you should see that lab for a more detailed explanation.

```

## Configure the ADC

In the previous section, we explained that ePWM2 would be triggering a SOC
event on the ADC. In this section, we will provide the code to configure the
ADC. More details about the configuration of the ADC can be found in 
[Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)](../../c2000_analog_subsystem/c2000_analog_to_digital_converter.md). 
However, notice that we have setup a SOC to be triggered by ePWM2 and that we
have setup the ADC to interrupt at the end of a conversion. This interrupt will
be used to trigger a CLA task that will implement the FIR lowpass filtering
routine. The ADC is also setup in continuous mode so that the ADC register
always contains the most recent sample.

Add ADC by clicking '+' in SysConfig screen to add ADC1.

![ADC1](images/cla_lab/lab_adc1.png)
  

![ADC2](images/cla_lab/lab_adc2.png)
  

```{admonition} For Devices F280039C:
Set analog reference voltage using asysctl parameter.

If the ADC module has already been added, select ASYSCTL in the ANALOG group 
and change the analog reference voltage to be an internal voltage of 2.5V. Otherwise, 
add ASYSCTL by clicking '+' in ANALOG group and then add internal 
reference of 2.5V.

![ASYSCTL](images/cla_lab/lab_adc_internal_ref.png)
 

```

## Configure the CLA

Now that we have reviewed the linker script additions needed by the CLA and the
CLA C compiler, we can go ahead and configure CLA. 

Add CLA by clicking '+' in SysConfig `System` group.

![CLA1](images/cla_lab/lab_cla1.png)
  

![CLA2](images/cla_lab/lab_cla2.png)
  

## Configure the MEMCFG

Now we can configure program and data memory of CLA1 using sysconfig MEMCFG 
module. Please use the table below to select LS memory for CLA program and CLA data 
for your device.

Device    | CLA Program Memory | CPU and CLA Shared Data Memory
----------|--------------------|-------------------------------
F28379xD  |       LS1          |    LS5
F2838x    |       LS1          |    LS5
F28004x   |       LS0          |    LS3
F28003x   |       LS0          |    LS1

Add MEMCFG by clicking '+' in SysConfig `System` group 
  
![MEMCFG1](images/cla_lab/lab_memcfg.png)
  

## Define the CLA tasks

In this section, we will define the necessary global variables and includes. 
A FIR lowpass filter of order 31 is used in this lab, hence,
the number of coefficients or length of the filter is 32. Notice that the
`coeffs` array contains the FIR filter coefficients, and the macro `FIR_LEN`
contains the FIR filter length. The `coeffs` array is one of the initialized
global variables stored in the `.const_bss` section. Additionally, observe that
we have defined another global variable `delay`, which is used as a delay line
for our FIR filter. 

```
#include "driverlib.h"
#include "board.h"
#include "lab_shared.h"
const float coeffs[FIR_LEN] = {
    -0.0006103139426196,-0.005592184655005,-0.01292485322836 ,-0.01926532895538,
    -0.01762908502044  ,-0.004303218458627, 0.01563724674838 , 0.02815885544785,
     0.01902562195175  ,-0.01290472511163 ,-0.04827630093442 ,-0.0545188692635,
    -0.006464860729499 , 0.09270744275212 , 0.2064249836238  , 0.2822241125204,
     0.2822241125204   , 0.2064249836238  , 0.09270744275212 ,-0.006464860729499,
    -0.0545188692635   ,-0.04827630093442 ,-0.01290472511163 , 0.01902562195175,
     0.02815885544785  , 0.01563724674838 ,-0.004303218458627,-0.01762908502044,
    -0.01926532895538  ,-0.01292485322836 ,-0.005592184655005,-0.0006103139426196
};
float delay[FIR_LEN];
```

Now we will provide the code for the FIR lowpass filtering task `Cla1Task1()`.
Observe that a sample is read from the ADC result register. Using the macros, 
a bias value is subtracted from the ADC sample, and
the result is scaled and stored in `filter_in`. This step is needed to convert
the PWM waveform into a square wave expressed in volts. Unlike the PWM
waveform, a square wave does not have a zero frequency component, which in
turn, allows us to observe a sinusoidal waveform at the output of our lowpass
filter. Subsequent code implements the FIR lowpass filter. Finally, observe
that the `filter_out` global variable contains the filtered sample. The
`filter_out` and `filter_in` global variables are stored in the
`Cla1ToCpuMsgRAM` section, which allows the CPU to access the FIR lowpass
filter input and output samples in the CLA ISR.

```
// FIR LP filter task.
__attribute__((interrupt)) void Cla1Task1(void)
{
    int16_t i;
    uint16_t tmpData;
    filter_out = 0.0;
    // Uncomment this to debug the CLA while connected to the debugger
    //__mdebugstop();
    // Read in new sample and subtract off the bias.
    tmpData = ADC_readResult(myADC0_RESULT_BASE, myADC0_SOC0);
    filter_in = ((float)(tmpData) - (float)(1 &lt;&lt; (ADC_BITS - 1)))*ADC_VSTEP;
    // Shift the delay line to the right by 1.
    #pragma UNROLL(FIR_LEN - 1)
    for (i = FIR_LEN - 1; i &gt; 0; i--) {
        delay[i] = delay[i-1];
        filter_out += coeffs[i]*delay[i];
    }
    // Add the new ADC sample to the delay line.
    delay[0] = filter_in;
    filter_out += coeffs[0]*delay[0];
}
```
Finally, we provide the code for the one time initialization routine
`Cla1Task8()`. This routine zeros out the delay line for the FIR filter.

```
__attribute__((interrupt)) void Cla1Task8(void)
{
    int16_t i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; ((int16_t)FIR_LEN); i++) {
        delay[i] = 0.0;
    }
}
```

This concludes the coding of the tasks in `lab_cla_tasks.cla`.

## Define global macros and variables in main

First, we will define some necessary macros and global variables. A description
of these macros and global variables will be addressed in the following
sections. Unless told otherwise, assume that all code goes in
`lab_main.c`.

```
#include "driverlib.h"
#include "device.h"
#include "board.h"
#define BUF_BITS    7                           // Buffer bits &lt;= 16.
#define BUF_LEN     (1 &lt;&lt; BUF_BITS)             // Buffer length.
#define BUF_MASK    ((uint16_t)(BUF_LEN - 1))   // Buffer mask.
float       ClaBuf[BUF_LEN];                    // Buffer to store filtered samples.
float       AdcBuf[BUF_LEN];                    // Buffer for un-filtered samples.
uint16_t    ClaBufIdx   = 0;                    // Buffer index for ClaBuf.
uint16_t    AdcBufIdx   = 0;                    // Buffer index for AdcBufIdx.
uint16_t    LedCtr      = 0;
#pragma DATA_SECTION(filter_out,"Cla1ToCpuMsgRAM");
float filter_out;
#pragma DATA_SECTION(filter_in,"Cla1ToCpuMsgRAM");
float filter_in;
```

## Define main()

Next, we will populate `main()` as shown below. 
That being said, we still need to know the system clock frequency in order to
configure the ePWM modules necessary for this lab. The system clock frequency
value that is configured via `Device_init()` is defined as `DEVICE_SYSCLK_FREQ`
in `<projectroot>/device/device.h`. Observe that the main function only handles
initialization routines. Most of the activity in this lab will lie in the CLA
tasks and interrupt service routine (ISR).

```
void main(void)
{
    // Configure system clock and PLL, enable peripherals, and configure
    // flash if used.
    Device_init();
    // Initialize the PIE module and vector table.
    Interrupt_initModule();
    Interrupt_initVectorTable();
	Board_init();
    // Enable global interrupts.
    EINT;
    // Enable real-time debug.
    ERTM;
    for(;;) {
        NOP;  // Do nothing.
    }
}
```

## Define the CLA ISR

Lastly, we will define the CLA ISR routine. Given the small order of our
filter, it is reasonable to assume that the runtime of `Cla1Task1()` will be
lower than the sampling period. Thus, this ISR will be called at a rate of
approximately 8kHz, i.e., the sampling rate of the ADC. Note that the values of
`filter_in` and `filter_out` are copied into the circular buffers `AdcBuf` and
`ClaBuf`, respectively. Finally, the global variable `LedCtr` is used to divide
the ISR call rate by 8000 in order to toggle an indicator LED at 1Hz.

```
__interrupt void cla1Isr1(void)
{
    // Clear interrupt flags.
    ADC_clearInterruptStatus(myADC0_BASE, ADC_INT_NUMBER1);
    Interrupt_clearACKGroup(INT_myCLA01_INTERRUPT_ACK_GROUP);
    // Store raw ADC sample in AdcBuf.
    AdcBuf[AdcBufIdx++] = filter_in;
    AdcBufIdx &amp;= BUF_MASK;
    // Store filtered output in ClaBuf.
    ClaBuf[ClaBufIdx++] = filter_out;
    ClaBufIdx &amp;= BUF_MASK;
    // Toggle LED1 at a rate of 1Hz.
    if (LedCtr++ &gt;= 8000) {
        GPIO_togglePin(myBoardLED0_GPIO);
        LedCtr = 0;
    }
}
```

This concludes the coding portion of this lab.

## Build and run interactive debug session

1. Ensure that the USB cable from your LaunchPad or controlCARD is connected to
   your computer.
2. Under the **Build** button, activate the **CPU1_RAM** build configuration.
   Build the program and fix any compilation errors.
   Alternatively, feel free to use the corresponding flash build configuration
   if desired.
3. Connect the ePWM1A GPIO pin to the ADCINA0 GPIO pin using a jumper cable. If
   you have an oscilloscope, connect a probe to the ePWM1A GPIO pin on your
   board.

**LaunchPad**

Device  | ADCINA0 Pin | EPWM1A Pin
--------|-------------|-----------
F28379D |   30        |  40
F2838x  |   n/a       |  n/a
F28004x |   70        |  80
F28003x |   70        |  40

**ControlCARD**

Device  | ADCINA0 Pin | EPWM1A Pin
--------|-------------|-----------
F28379D |   9         |  49
F2838x  |   9         |  49
F28004x |   9         |  49
F28003x |   9         |  49
   
4. Now we will start the debug session. Under the debug button, start the debug
   session using the new configuration. You should now see the debugging
   session open up and the debugger should have reached `main()`.
5. Click the **Resume** button. You should see the LED on your board toggling
   at about 1Hz which indicates that the CLA ISR is being called at 8kHz as
   expected. This also suggests that `Cla1Task1()` is completing at a rate of
   8kHz.
   
6. Now we will view the unfiltered and filtered waveforms in real-time using
   the two circular buffers implemented in the CLA ISR. Click on
  **Tools→Graph→Dual Time**, set **Acquisition Buffer Size** to be
  **128**, set **Dsp Data Type** to be **32 bit floating point**, set
  **Sampling Rate Hz** to be **8000**, set **Start Address A** to be
  **AdcBuf**, set **Start Address B** to be **ClaBuf**, set **Display Data
   Size** to be **64**, set **Time Display Unit** to be **ms**, and leave the
   other settings as their default value. Click **OK** and you should see two
   plot windows open up. 

```{admonition} Important
   Note: If you do not see CCS menu **Tools → Graph**, please refer to 
   [Getting Started (Setting CCS for graph)](../../c2000_get_started/c2000_getstarted.md) 
   to see the instruction on how to enable CCS graphing tool in your perspective.
   
```

![Plot Configuration](images/cla_lab/plot_settings.png)

7. Activate the **Continuous Refresh** option in both of the plot windows and
   watch the plot windows update. If all is well, the **DualTimeA** plot window
   should contain a square waveform and the **DualTimeB** plot window should
   contain a sinusoidal waveform. Note the effect that the lower sampling rate
   has on the sinusoidal waveform.

# Analog System Interconnect

The Analog Subsystem Interconnect permits a single pin to route a signal
to multiple analog modules. Thus, enabling a very flexible pin usage, allowing
for smaller device packages. 

```{admonition} Note:
The F28x7x and F2838x devices do not have an analog subsystem interconnect.
```

## Example - F28004x Analog Subsystem Interconnect

The DAC outputs, comparator subsystem inputs, PGA functions, and digital inputs
are multiplexed with the ADC inputs.

The connections for each of the portions within the analog subsystem
interconnect can be found within the 'Analog Subsystem' section of the device's
Technical Reference Manual (TRM).

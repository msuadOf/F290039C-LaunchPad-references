# Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA)

A Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) is an integrated module that amplifies small
input signals to increase the dynamic range of the downstream ADC and CMPSS
modules. The amplification is done through a programmable gain amplifier.

Not all C2000 devices have a PGA. Refer to the 
[Peripheral Reference Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/spru566)
for a list of supported modules on your device.

## When would you use it?
The PGA module is typically used to amplify signals from
analog sensors such as temperature sensors, pressure sensors, and strain
gauges. The amplified signal is then digitized by the analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) module.

## Key Benefits of using a PGA:
* Reduces cost and design effort over external standalone amplifiers
  * On-chip integration ensures compatibility with ADC and CMPSS
  * Internally powered by VDDA and VSSA
* Adaptable to various performance needs
  * Software selectable gain and filter settings
* Hardware based analog offset and gain trimming reduces offset and gain error
  * Instead of software post-processing

## PGA Block Diagram

1. PGA_IN is the positive input to the PGA op-amp. The signal applied to this
pin will be amplified by the PGA. If the PGA is not used then this input can be
used as a regular ADC/CMPSS pin.

2. The active component in the PGA is an embedded operational amplifier
(op-amp) that is configured as a non-inverting amplifier.

3. The gain modes of 3x, 6x, 12x, and 24x are software-selectable. The gain of
the PGA is determined by a preset ratio between resistors Rout and Rgnd. 
Refer to your device's <i>Technical Reference Manual</i> for ideal target values for the gain resistors.

    $Gain = 1 + \frac{R_{OUT}}{R_{GND}}$

4. PGA_OUT is an internal signal available for sampling and monitoring by the
internal ADC and CMPSS modules. 

5. The PGA output can be routed to a pin through an embedded series resistor for
the purpose of low-pass filtering the amplified signal. The cut-off frequency
can be estimated using the standard low-pass RC equation of: 

    $f_c = 1/(2\pi RC)$ 

If the PGA is not used then the PGA_OF pin can be used as a regular ADC/CMPSS pin.

# Comparator Subsystem (CMPSS)

Comparator Subsystem (CMPSS) modules are useful for supporting applications such
as peak current mode control, switched-mode power, power factor correction, and
voltage trip monitoring. 

Each CMPSS module has two comparators- a high comparator (COMPH) and a low
comparator (COMPL).'High' and 'Low' in this context just refers to the location 
within the CMPSS module.

## Comparator Subsystem Block Diagram

Each CMPSS module is designed around a pair of analog comparators which
generates a digital output indicating if the voltage on the positive input is
greater than the voltage on the negative input. 

The diagram below is for the F28004x device:

The **positive input** to the comparator is always driven from an external pin. 

The **negative input** can be driven by either an external pin or an internal
programmable 12-bit digital-to-analog (DAC) as a reference voltage. 

$V_{DAC} = \frac{DACxVALA * DACREF}{4096}$

### Comparator Truth Table
Voltages              | Output
----------------------|--------
Voltage A < Voltage B | 0
Voltage A > Voltage B | 1

Values written to the DAC can take effect immediately or be synchronized with
ePWM events. A ramp generator is optionally available to the control
the internal DAC reference value for one comparator in the module.

Each comparator output is feed through a programmable digital filter that can
remove spurious trip signals. 

The output of the CMPSS generates trip signals to
the ePWM event trigger submodule and GPIO structure.

# CMPSS_LITE 

CMPSS and CMPSS_LITE share a common architecture, but some features are
supported only by the full CMPSS variant (full module) and not the CMPSS_LITE
variant (reduced functionality and performance). CMPSS_LITE does not have the
capability to do DAC ramp generation or have a low DAC output on the external
pin.

Note that the device data sheet
indicates electrical characteristics for the two variants separately.

    ## **Diode Emulation Support**

    Diode emulation mode is a mode of operation of power transistors to emulate the blocking 
    function of a diode, which reduces losses in the diode. To emulate the blocking function 
    of a diode, the current through the transistor is monitored and changes in current flow 
    direction are detected by comparing the current with a constant threshold. Once in the 
    diode emulation mode, it is expected that the comparator thresholds will be switched 
    to a different setting.

    ## **New Ramp Generator Features**

    The type 6 CMPSS is capable of having dual ramp generators for a CMPSS module, 
    one for the high comparator and one for the low comparator.

    ![Ramp Generator (Low Comparator)](images/cmpss/RampGeneratorLow.png)

    These ramp generators can count up or down and apply a divide value RAMPCLKDIV 
    to the counter.

    The ramp clock can be determined from this value by calculating RAMPCLK = 
    SYSCLK /(RAMPCLKDIV + 1).

    ## **External Filter Input Support**

    The Digit Filter blocks can be used to filter external digital signals EXT_FILTIN_H/L
    when the CMPSS core is not in use. These are connected from X-BAR outputs. To configure 
    the external digital signals, use COMPDACHCTL.FILTINSEL or COMPDACHCTL.FILTINSEL.

# Embedded Pulse Generator (EPG)

C2000 real-time microcontrollers architecture includes an embedded 
customizable pattern and clock generator that can be used by the 
application to test in various scenarios.

Not all C2000 devices have an EPG module. Refer to the

for a list of supported modules on your device.

## What is Embedded Pulse Generator (EPG)

The Embedded Pattern Generator (EPG) module is a customizable pattern and clock
generator that could serve many test and application scenarios that require a
simple pattern generator or a periodic clock generator. The EPG module can also
be used to capture an incoming serial stream of data.

The EPG module provides the ability to design new clock generators, pulse width
modulators (PWMs), serial communication modules, and so forth.

The EPG module can be used as an independent peripheral or it can be used along
side other peripherals such as CAN. When used alongside other peripherals, such
as CAN, EPG can provide signal patterns for testing and running diagnostic
inside the C2000â„¢ device.

## Clock Generator

The EPG can be used to generate clock signals. These clock signals can be used
internally by the EPG (the EPG SIGGENx modules), or be exported out of the EPG
through EPGOUTx signals. If exported out of the EPG through the EPGOUTx
signals, then these clock signals can be used by other peripherals through the
XBARs or be sent out of the device through GPIOs.

## Signal Generator

EPG signal generators (SIGGENx) modules can generate or capture complex digital
patterns. SIGGENx modules can be configured to many different modes
(rotate right mode, shift right mode, and so forth). SIGGENx modules are
clocked from the CLKGENx modules. Therefore, the CLKGENx modules must be
configured.

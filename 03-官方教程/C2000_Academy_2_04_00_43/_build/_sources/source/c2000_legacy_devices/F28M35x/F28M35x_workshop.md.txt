# F28M35x Workshop

:::{warning} Disclaimer The workshop materials on this page are no longer being
   updated or maintained, and are provided "as is". However, the workshop
   materials can still be very useful for learning about the device. The CCS
   projects which are used with the lab exercise source files may need to be
   recreated for use with later versions of the software. Also, the hardware
   target (ie. development board) may be discontinued.
:::

The C2000 F28M35x Microcontroller Workshop is a hands-on technical course based
on the F28M35H52C1 device. This device is a multicore system-on-chip
microcontroller unit (MCU) with independent communication and real-time control
subsystems. Learning is accomplished through detailed presentation materials
and hands-on lab exercises. This workshop has been developed to decrease the
learning curve from months to days, reduce development time, and accelerate
product time to market. Also, this workshop is perfect for both the beginner
and advanced users. 

The workshop starts with the basic concepts and progresses to more advanced
topics in a logical fashion. Each topic and lab exercise builds on the previous
one that was presented, running a common theme throughout the workshop. All of
the lab exercises are written using the Peripheral Register Header Files and
are performed on the F28M35H52C1 Experimenter kit. The materials guide the user
through system initialization, peripheral configuration, and inter-processor
communications.

# LF240x Workshop

:::{warning} Disclaimer The workshop materials on this page are no longer being
   updated or maintained, and are provided "as is". However, the workshop
   materials can still be very useful for learning about the device. The CCS
   projects which are used with the lab exercise source files may need to be
   recreated for use with later versions of the software. Also, the hardware
   target (ie. development board) may be discontinued.
:::

The C2000 TMS320LF240x Microcontroller Workshop is a hands-on technical course
based on the TMS320LF2407A device. Learning is accomplished through detailed
presentation materials and hands-on lab exercises. This workshop has been
developed to decrease the learning curve from months to days, reduce
development time, and accelerate product time to market. Also, this workshop is
perfect for both the beginner and advanced users. 

The workshop starts with the basic concepts and progresses to more advanced
topics in a logical fashion. Each topic and lab exercise builds on the previous
one that was presented, running a common theme throughout the workshop. All of
the lab exercises are written in assembly and are performed on the Spectrum
Digital EVM320LF2407A Evaluation Module. The materials guide the user through
system initialization, peripheral setup, and programming an application into
flash memory.

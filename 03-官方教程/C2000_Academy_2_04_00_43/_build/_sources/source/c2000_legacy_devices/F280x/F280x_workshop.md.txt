# F280x Workshop

:::{warning} Disclaimer The workshop materials on this page are no longer being
   updated or maintained, and are provided "as is". However, the workshop
   materials can still be very useful for learning about the device. The CCS
   projects which are used with the lab exercise source files may need to be
   recreated for use with later versions of the software. Also, the hardware
   target (ie. development board) may be discontinued.
:::

The C2000 TMS320F280x Microcontroller Workshop is a hands-on technical course
based on the TMS320F2808 device. Learning is accomplished through detailed
presentation materials and hands-on lab exercises. This workshop has been
developed to decrease the learning curve from months to days, reduce
development time, and accelerate product time to market. Also, this workshop is
perfect for both the beginner and advanced users. 

The workshop starts with the basic concepts and progresses to more advanced
topics in a logical fashion. Each topic and lab exercise builds on the previous
one that was presented, running a common theme throughout the workshop. All of
the lab exercises are written using the Peripheral Register Header Files and
are performed on the Spectrum Digital eZdsp F2808 target board. The materials
guide the user through system initialization, peripheral setup, and programming
an application into flash memory using the Code Composer Studio on-chip flash
programmer.

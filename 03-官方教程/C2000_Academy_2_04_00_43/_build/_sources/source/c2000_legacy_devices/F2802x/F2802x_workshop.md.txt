# F2802x Workshop

:::{warning} Disclaimer The workshop materials on this page are no longer being
   updated or maintained, and are provided "as is". However, the workshop
   materials can still be very useful for learning about the device. The CCS
   projects which are used with the lab exercise source files may need to be
   recreated for use with later versions of the software. Also, the hardware
   target (ie. development board) may be discontinued.
 :::

The C2000 TMS320F2802x Microcontroller Workshop is a hands-on technical course
based on the TMS320F28027 device. This device shares many common features and
peripherals that are also found on the other C2000 family members. Therfore,
this workshop is ideal for anyone interested in learning more about the C2000
microcontrollers. Learning is accomplished through detailed presentation
materials and hands-on lab exercises. This workshop has been developed to
decrease the learning curve from months to days, reduce development time, and
accelerate product time to market. Also, this workshop is perfect for both the
beginner and advanced users. 

The workshop starts with the basic concepts and progresses to more advanced
topics in a logical fashion. Each topic and lab exercise builds on the previous
one that was presented, running a common theme throughout the workshop. All of
the lab exercises are written using the Peripheral Register Header Files and
are performed on the F28027 controlSTICK. The materials guide the user through
system initialization, peripheral setup, and programming an application into
flash memory using the Code Composer Studio on-chip flash programmer.

5. Reset, Interrupts, and System Initialization -- <i> Lab: Watchdog and interrupts </i>
6. Control Peripherals -- <i> Lab: Generate and graph a PWM waveform </i>
7. Flash Programming -- <i> Lab: Run the code from flash memory </i>
8. The Next Step...

## Running the Labs

In order to run the labs, you will need:

- PC running Windows XP or greater

- Adobe Acrobat Reader

- F28027 controlSTICK - Discontinued -- Recommended F28027 Experimenter Kit (product number: TMSDOCK28027)

- Code Composer Studio (CCS) v4.2.0 

- Jumper Wire

```{admonition} Note : Your CCS installation must include the following options in each category:
	- Processor Support: Select "C2000 real-time MCUs"
	- Select Emulators: Choose "TI XDS Debug Probe Support"

```

## Workshop Materials - Revision 2.1 December 2010
